					<center><i>
						<div class="greenCenter">Welcome to the City of Nodd.</div>
						<div class="greenCenter">The labyrinthine streets before you are brimming with beasts of all shapes and sizes. Their otherworldly gurgles and groans fill your ears, and their reek fills your snout. </div>
						<div class="greenCenter">Sinister towers silently loom, their windows like eyes of something hungry and cruel. As strangers enter buildings through toothy maw-shaped doors, you can’t help but wonder if they’ll be coming back out again.</div>
						<div class="greenCenter">Strangely, the city itself doesn’t look entirely constructed, but rather grown - chitinous architecture appears to have erupted from fleshy ground. A shopkeep lances a boil on the wall outside her front door. You could swear having seen the building wince, ever so slightly.</div>
						<div class="greenCenter">Dirty, glass-covered walkways span between buildings, and warped bridges arch over sickly canals. The same putrid liquid gurgles from the fanged mouths of grotesque fountains. These are surrounded by bizarre gardens of nightmarish plants, whose ill-pruned tendrils choke anything nearby - perhaps in a literal sense, if the vine-wrapped corpse you just passed is any indication.</div>
						<div class="greenCenter">It’s dark, and hard to discern the time of day; the sky is a vile green, boiling with clouds. It’s humid, and moisture seems to cling to buildings and people alike. Steam billows from grates underfoot, and a luminous haze of arcane smoke seems to hang in the air. The glow of lamps and signs pierce the murky gloom. </div>
						<div class="greenCenter">Tents, carts, and kiosks line the streets; beggars, buskers, performers, vendors of all colors and flavors and smells peddle their wares and services. In some cases it’s hard to tell what’s being sold. The windows of shops and restaurants are all densely festooned with anything that might draw one inside.</div>
						<div class="greenCenter">The smells are palpable. Each passage seems to assault one’s senses in a new way - strange musks, the scent of bizarre cuisine, otherworldly drugs, blood, death, filth. </div>
						<div class="greenCenter">Carriages pulled by immense, deer-like abominations known as miggwitches can be seen. The beasts, despite their docile nature, appear to have reins attached to their genitalia.</div>
						<div class="greenCenter">Similar sadistic indulgences can be seen all around. A well-adorned (and well-fed) creature on a palanquin hauled by servants passes by. Someone is walking someone else on all fours with a leash. Someone is picked up by their neck scruff and dropped into the toothy maw of something much bigger. </div>
						<div class="greenCenter">In every direction, the city throbs with dark desire; everywhere you look, the city hungers.</div>
					</i></center>

				<div id="Introduction" class="tab" style="display:none">
					<div class="worldTitle">A City of Monsters, Magic, and Madness</div>
					
					<div class="worldtext">Nodd refers to both the city and the gray expanse surrounding it, known as the Abyss. It is not currently understood where or even what the greater realm of Nodd is; the further you travel away from the city, the greater the stories seem to vary. Those who have traveled the furthest have either never returned, or have inexplicably ended up at the city once again.</div>
					
					<div class="worldtext">Arcane energy - called "gloam" - is both generated and consumed by the city itself; it manifests as spells, architecture, objects, plants, beasts, and even citizens.</div>
					
					<div class="worldtext">The City is watched over and controlled by the Council of Nodd, a secretive establishment made up of mysterious figures. The council has a number of attendants that enforce laws and keep watch over Nodd’s citizens. </div>
					
					<div class="worldtext">​If Nodd becomes too orderly and smoothly-run, chaotic and unexplained events are said to occur. Bizarre weather, unusual behavior among citizens, arcane phenomena, and manifestations of monsters are all products of excess order. For this reason, the Council seeks to control this inevitable chaos by enforcing chaotic behavior in citizens. </div>
					
					<div class="worldtext">This means that the city's laws and social conventions are not written with the ultimate goal of order, but rather a sort of controlled chaos. Laws change frequently, sustaining an unending upheaval. Vanity, exhibition, exploitation, violence, materialism and excess are all encouraged; citizens are urged to endlessly indulge. If a citizen ceases to generate enough chaos, they’re dealt with accordingly.</div>
					
					<div class="worldtext">​In addition to warding off naturally-occurring chaos, the spent energy of chaotic acts can be converted back into usable gloam. Following chaotic events, this spent energy is collected through the Conduit - a steeple-like structure at the top of the Council Spire. The way the conduit works is a closely-guarded Council secret. The conduit somehow collects and rejuvenates the energy, and allows it to be concentrated into a raw fuel.</div>
				</div>
				
				<div id="History" class="tab" style="display:none">
					<div class="worldTitle">History</div>
				
					<div class="worldtext">The further back one delves, the less consistent the story - much like traveling away from the City. Even Noddish literature seems to contradict itself, painting a paradoxical picture of the past.</div>
					
					<div class="worldtext">That being said, it seems consistent that gloam was not commonly manipulated in the beginning in the ways it is today. Most things were grown, bred, harvested, built, or brewed, and the anomalies that weren't easily accounted for were seen as gifts - or punishment - from the city. Mages were rare, and seen as very gifted if not otherworldly. Magic was much less nuanced, predictable, and powerful; in these times, a mage capable of summoning flames was something the entire city knew well - and feared. Only very important people were resurrected, and only if the corpse was relatively unscathed - and even then, this couldn’t be done reliably.</div>
					
					<div class="worldtext">There were only insiders in the beginning, and they were less varied. </div>
					
					<div class="worldTitle">Controlling Chaos</div>
					
					<div class="worldtext">After countless bizarre events, it had long been suspected that excess order in Nodd leads to chaos to counteract it - any time things seemed to be operating as intended, something bizarre and horrific would take place. This pattern seemed to appear at any scale, from an individual’s life to the city as a whole. The rare, gifted mage was known for appearing able to avert these swells of chaos (or divert them onto others). The Council performed a series of experiments to try to determine the truth of these questionable legends, and if and how it can be controlled.</div>
					
					<div class="worldtext">An unassuming mephitoad was the subject of these fateful experiments, the details of which remain a mystery to Nodd’s citizens to this day. All that is known is that the hypothesis was said to have been confirmed at this time, and the Night of the Mothertoad then ensued. </div>
					
					<div class="worldTitle">The Night of the Mothertoad</div>
					
					<div class="worldtext">​The concentrated chaos resulted in a corrupted mephitoad - something far more than what the Council could contain. The creature was now not only sapient, but a godlike, rapidly-spreading organism. It began to take over the city, its growing mass assimilating terrified citizens and spawning hundreds of partially-corrupted mephitoads. As it did, the city itself seemed to grow, new architecture erupting from the chaos-dense soil.</div>
					
					<div class="worldtext">The Council sought out the City’s most powerful mage, Illa Phasmere, offering her a position in the council if she subdued the rampaging, rapidly-multiplying mephitoad. </div>
					
					<div class="worldtext">On this night, the citizens, too, were embroiled in a civil war - some were entranced by the prospect of being a part of something far greater, the promise of unending bliss groaning from the slack jaws of the freshly-assimilated. Others, less enchanted by the idea of being part of an ever-swelling sentient ooze, sought to fight for their individuality and freedom.  </div>
					
					<div class="worldtext">Phasmere and her followers were able to destroy most of the Mothertoad - and much of the city, in the process. Before the mephitoad was entirely eradicated, it was offered power by the Council, which it accepted.</div>
					
					<div class="worldtext">Illa Phasmere and The Mothertoad were now the Council’s two official cityspeakers - called the citygods - founding The House of Umbrasia and the House of Viviria, respectively. The house of Viviria would represent life and corruption, whereas Umbrasia was to represent death and destruction.</div>
					
					<div class="worldtext">Consulting the two godlike entities for guidance, the Council formulated new laws in an attempt to orchestrate a controlled chaos.</div>
					
					<div class="worldtext">The forming of the two houses seemed to yield a sudden increase in magic usage and prowess, as they brought together those of similar goals and views to further develop their skill.  This trend led to the theory that more belief would garner more energy, and GodGrinder was established as a sort of experiment.</div>
					
					<div class="worldTitle">GodGrinder</div>
					
					<div class="worldtext">The Council announced a trial they called GodGrinder. This would be a death match tournament, and the victor would be made a Citygod, alongside Illa Phasmere and The Mothertoad.</div>
					
					<div class="worldtext">Mages trained and scrambled to empower themselves in various ways before the event. </div>
					
					<div class="worldtext">The trial lasted many sleeps, and hundreds of lives were lost. Finally, only two remained.</div>
					
					<div class="worldtext">Filo Rooke and Mercian Vetch fought, and Mercian won - at the cost of her face, mutilated in an arcane explosion. Such injuries are unusually crippling for Lehlts, who rely on the envy of others to remain beautiful - and are resistant to cosmetic magics as a result.</div>
					
					<div class="worldtext">The Council then made Mercian a Citygod. To her horror, they then resurrected Filo - whose body was mostly in tact and thus feasible to revive in this era - and made him a Citygod as well.</div>
					
					<div class="worldtext">With two more of Nodd's most powerful mages in the Council's grasp, the city grew.</div>
					
					<div class="worldTitle">The Door of Knowledge</div>
					
					<div class="worldtext">Quin Aven was a petrid - a gargoyle-like creature - whose entire consciousness was confined to the shape of a doorknocker.</div>
					
					<div class="worldtext">While most petrids are excised from their host building upon spawning, Quin refused this, as he had no viable body as most petrids do - excision would essentially mean decapitation. While decapitation seemed as though it could be no worse than his current circumstances, it certainly did not seem any better.</div>
					
					<div class="worldtext">Most doorknockers lack meaningful awareness, but Quin was not only aware, but an intellectual. His mistress - the house owner - would bring him books and scrolls to enrich and occupy his restless mind. Over years of poring over these arcane texts, he learned elaborate methods by which he was able create his own artifacts. He began relying less and less on the City's gifts - harvested and resold by the Council - and began making his own tools to use and share with others. While Quin wasn't the only one capable of doing this, it was a strange and complex art reserved for only the greatest minds in Nodd - and one that was generally kept secret, lest one's hobbies invoke the Council's wrath.</div>
					
					<div class="worldtext">Regardless of his secrecy, this very thing befell the poor petrid. Without warning or explanation, Quin was abducted for a mysterious new creation - now thought by many to be the Conduit itself. </div>
					
					<div class="worldtext">The Omnillian citadel was constructed around Quin's original building, which now only makes up the central chamber where Quin resides. The Conduit was installed at the top of the Council Spire shortly thereafter, and the City's resources became nearly endless. Nodd grew in size in every dimension. Homes became richly furnished, and poverty became nearly irrelevant.</div>
					
					<div class="worldtext">Technology flourished, and formulae known as spells were developed in order to further control gloam.</div>
					
					<div class="worldtext">Citizens were now increasingly encouraged to indulge, as they still are today.</div>
					
					<div class="worldTitle">The Morphoria Mystery</div>
					
					<div class="worldtext">The last house, Morphoria, is perhaps one of Nodd's greatest mysteries.</div>
					
					<div class="worldtext">Nobody really seems to recall when or even why it was founded, and stories are only consistent in that they vary. One would assume this means the house is older than the others, but the stories surrounding Morphoria actually become less varied the further back you go - all anyone seems to agree on is that it definitely wasn't there in the beginning, while nobody in the house can quite fully agree on what happened a few moments ago. </div>
					
					<div class="worldTitle">Present Day</div>
					
					<div class="worldtext">The Council has recently announced a defect in the Conduit, resulting in a sudden deficit in gloam.</div>
					
					<div class="worldtext">Citizens have begun to panic, increasingly unable to generate income through various acts of chaos. Fewer citizens are being resurrected. A state of unease grips the city.</div>
					
					<div class="worldtext">In addition, there has been talk of strange, otherworldly creatures known as outsiders appearing before the gates of the city. These beautiful creatures have attracted the interest of the Council, who has taken to calling them the Chosen Ones.</div>
				</div>
				
				<div id="Magic" class="tab" style="display:none">
					<div class="worldTitle">Mages</div>
					
					<div class="worldText">While you don't need to be a mage to use magic, many citizens consider themselves mages to some degree, or are employed (or owned) by them. Some are passionate if not religious about their roles, while others dabble, preferring to work as apprentices to pick up a few showy fireworks to draw attention at bars, enhance themselves aesthetically, or otherwise aid or improve their personal life in various ways. </div>
					
					<div class="worldTitle">Houses & Cults</div>
					
					<div class="worldText">Many mages seek the prestige and reliability of an education from one of the six official houses, which each represent an aspect of magic. The houses' fellowship splits itself into two sects, each representing a different nuance of the house. Each differs in its tactics, aesthetic, rituals, and belief.</div>
					
					<div class="worldText">For those who can't find what they're looking for, or for those who do not wish to be associated with the Council, cults are an option. These operate in the same fashion as the houses, but are run independently by powerful mages.</div>
					
					<div class="worldTitle">Familiars</div>
					
					<div class="worldText">Most mages have one or more familiars - a special animal companion with whom they’ve bonded. </div>
					
					<div class="worldText">Many mages pit their familiars against one another as a form of sport, and some fight alongside their familiars in combat. </div>
				</div>
				
				<div id="Flora and Fauna" class="tab" style="display:none">
					<div class="worldTitle">Flora & Fauna</div>
					
					<div class="worldText">Like insiders, animals and plants spawn in and around Nodd from the city's needs - which also demand a basic ecosystem. These can be of any appearance, but some consistent forms have been identified. </div>
					
					<div class="worldText">Any bestial species can occasionally manifest as what is effectively a sapient counterpart. The opposite is also true, resulting in what’s known colloquially as a “feral”. This term may also apply to any sapient insider that’s been temporarily rendered a beast via transformative magic.</div>
				</div>
				
				<div id="Architecture" class="tab" style="display:none">
					<div class="worldTitle">Architecture</div>
					
					<div class="worldText">Like citizens, animals, and plants, Nodd's architecture also spawns from the city's needs. While legally considered inanimate, even Nodd’s buildings are living things. Old, abandoned buildings are culled during The Pruning, and new architecture spawns during Sporefall. </div>
					
					<div class="worldText">A freshly spawned building is called a “sporeling”. These tiny buildings are widely accepted to be exceptionally cute. </div>
					
					<div class="worldText">Buildings grow, age, occasionally fall ill, feed, and defecate (if an insider offers you "gutter grog", by all means refuse). Buildings vary in their level of awareness; those that seem a bit more conscious may occasionally exhibit mood shifts, or may misbehave in various ways. Those that are unable to be dealt with are generally euthanized.</div>
					
					<div class="worldText">Buildings may become possessive of their occupants, and a particularly possessive building may lock doors and windows in an effort to keep their owners at home. Some may utilize fixtures such as showers or ovens in an attempt to kill any guests they deem to be a threat, rationally or not.</div>
					
					<div class="worldText">Free housing is available to citizens, and even the most basic accommodations tend to be on the luxurious side. </div>
					
					<div class="worldText">To differentiate from the Arcane Houses, one does not generally refer to one’s “house” in Nodd, but one’s “chambers” or  “home”.</div>
					
					<div class="worldTitle">Furniture</div>
					
					<div class="worldText">Furniture, too, is alive in Nodd.</div>
					
					<div class="worldText">Ideally, furniture will do little more than pulsate and occasionally shift around. Furniture that moves too much or exhibits other undesirable behavior is said to be “ambulant”. Ambulant furniture can either be tamed, or euthanized and stuffed.</div>
					
					<div class="worldText">“Dead furniture” is considered less appealing and natural than furniture that’s still alive.</div>
					
					<div class="worldText">When furniture dies, or is euthanized without the corpse being used, it’s sometimes made into a food item called “couch steak”. Couch steak refers to any cut of meat taken from cushioned furniture, such as couches, ottomans, armchairs, and beds.</div>
					
					<div class="worldText">Parts that are hard and chitinous, such as legs, may be cracked open like crab legs. This is known colloquially as “couch shrimp”.</div>
					
					<div class="worldText">Some furniture pieces, particularly quadrupedal sorts, sport visible genitalia. Oftentimes an ottoman or sofa will be castrated before it's euthanized in an attempt to address ambulant misbehavior, such as humping. The testicles of furniture can be used culinarily, and in this context are called “couch potatoes”. This is generally considered to be bottom-shelf fare.</div>
					
					<div class="worldTitle">The Pruning & HearthHunt</div>
					
					<div class="worldText">Every turn, old, vacant buildings are destroyed during The Pruning. During this time, the Council sends forth destructive forces to clean up old and dilapidated structures to make room for new growth. </div>
					
					<div class="worldText">HearthHunt precedes this event. This refers to citizens exploring abandoned areas of Nodd to scavenge usable artifacts left behind before The Pruning takes place. </div>
					
					<div class="worldText">Architecture becomes especially anxious during this time, and may trap hearthhunters inside in an effort to make themselves appear occupied and wanted, and therefore safe from culling. The buildings may also attempt to spawn desirable items and amenities such as banquet spreads and opulent furnishings to lure in potential owners - but these items are usually what hearthhunters mean to take before abandoning the building to its fate.</div>
					
					<div class="worldText">Some buildings don’t lure hunters in an attempt to be owned, but simply out of spite in their final moments. In either case, this makes the HearthHunt a sport rife with peril.</div>
				</div>
				
				<div id="Socialization" class="tab" style="display:none">
					<div class="worldTitle">Entertainment & Social Life</div>
					
					<div class="worldText">​Due to the mechanics of gloam generation, Nodd is a lively and indulgent environment. The city is largely structured around entertainment.</div>
					
					<div class="worldText">Street shows and vendors line the streets, and shops ruthlessly compete to offer the most novel, interesting, exceptional, and indulgent products and experiences. Originality is richly rewarded, and virtually nothing is too bizarre, vile, or sacred to be made into a paid attraction or item.</div>
					
					<div class="worldText">​It is widely accepted that one generates more chaos the more people perceive the act. As such, Nodd culture maintains a high tolerance for vanity and flamboyance, and its citizens often tend to be very expressive by means of fashion, body modifications, material possessions, housing, pets, and more. </div>
					
					<div class="worldTitle">Transportation</div>
					
					<div class="worldText">Common transportation in Nodd includes beast-driven carriages, balloons and dirigibles, canal boats, monorails and elevators, teleportation, and various creatures and constructs. Many citizens own a beast or construct for personal transportation - a privileged citizen may own both a terrestrial and an aerial mount, and possibly even an aquatic mount for traversing Nodd's network of underground canals. </div>
					
					<div class="worldText">There’s also the popular hoverboard-like device known as the scarab, which can zip quickly between buildings - or directly into, as the case often is. </div>
					
					<div class="worldTitle">Ego Bracer</div>
					
					<div class="worldText">A citizen’s entire life can be accessed via their ego bracer. This device attunes with the wearer, and can send messages, search the Arcanet, store items and familiars, record holograms, and more. The main screen contains one's ego file - this contains basic information about them, and lists items and creatures for quick access.</div>
					
					<div class="worldText">The screen doesn’t have buttons of any kind, but rather demands the user concentrate on the desired information. The bracer’s audio will be present in the user’s head, and visuals will manifest on the bracer’s screen as a magic hologram. Only the user will see or hear this information; others will only see a colorful jumble of symbols and shapes. If the user is unable to concentrate, the hologram and sounds will fail to manifest. If the user cannot see, one can learn to manifest the information in other ways, or purchase an ego bracer for one’s specific situation.</div>
					
					<div class="worldText">Most ego bracers also act as a basic utility artifact with several spells one can browse in a list. For a basic ego bracer, these generally include things like light-producing spells, heat and cold, a spout of clean drinking water, and basic self-defense spells. More expensive models may be capable of casting better spells, but usually a mage will have a separate, higher-quality artifact for anything more powerful or specialized.</div>
					
					<div class="worldText">Ego bracers need a gloam cartridge to function. Gloam’s natural green color can be seen in the bracer’s screen, but this can usually be changed in the bracer’s settings - at a small energy cost.</div>
				</div>
				
				<div id="Economy" class="tab" style="display:none">
					<div class="worldTitle">Economy</div>
					
					<div class="worldText">​Nodd's currency is gloam, the same as its energy source. One can use a mage kiosk - machines accessible all over Nodd - to exchange immaterial currency for a cartridge of raw gloam, and vice versa.</div>
					
					<div class="worldText">Necessities in Nodd are expensive, whereas luxuries are relatively easy to come by if not forced upon citizens. This isn’t to say the wealthy don’t have access to indulgences the poor do not, but simply that substances, pleasurable services, and indulgent products are far more affordable than a bar of soap (one that doesn’t intoxicate you, at least).</div>
					
					<div class="worldText">It is hard if not impossible to remain sober in Nodd without wealth; the Council prefers all its citizens be intoxicated, such that they’re more driven to cause chaos. Only the wealthy can afford to be sober, abstain from sex or violence, or even dress modestly - though certainly not all choose to live this way once they’re financially secure, and most continue to mindlessly indulge.</div>
					
					<div class="worldText">While it is possible to sustain oneself without sex or violence, it generally takes great creative or intellectual effort to do so. Artists, entertainers, and inventors may be able to generate enough gloam to afford food, medicine, and self-defense spells if their creations and performances draw enough attention. Some may prefer to invest in the talents of others, and serve as an agent for up-and-coming mages.</div>
					
					<div class="worldText">While specific factors are unknown, it’s widely accepted that a citizen stops being resurrected if their gloam balance remains low or stagnant for too long. This is a constant looming threat to citizens, and encourages all to behave chaotically regardless of their financial needs or material desire.</div>
				</div>
				
				<div id="Life and Death" class="tab" style="display:none">
					<div class="worldTitle">Death</div>
					
					<div class="worldText">Death in Nodd isn't permanent - as long as a citizen has been generating sufficient chaos. If this is the case, the individual will be resurrected, no matter the circumstance - and no matter the state or location of their corpse. The corpse will remain, and the citizen will receive a new body, in whatever state it was in before the time of death or terminal damage. However, the memory of the experience remains. This process happens in the Court of Resurrection. It takes both insiders and outsiders roughly one sleep (about 24 hours) to form and stabilize enough to leave the facility.</div>
					
					<div class="worldText">Whether or not one will be resurrected is unknown until they've been resurrected, creating much uncertainty and distress. The one exception to this is an "immortal" citizen, whose ego file shows an infinity symbol. This honor is thought to be bestowed on particularly valuable citizens for a variety of reasons, and denotes that they will be resurrected no matter how many times they die. However, this may be revoked at any time.</div>
					
					<div class="worldTitle">Aging & Corruption</div>
					
					<div class="worldText">Alongside aging, citizens undergo a process known as corruption, which makes a citizen more in tune with the city's magic, and renders their appearance gradually more monstrous. Acute corruption is also achievable by various means, and is usually a terrible idea.</div>
					
					<div class="worldText">Particularly with the technology of resurrection, it is thought to be possible to live forever in Nodd, though the city's dangers make this difficult.</div>
					
					<div class="worldTitle">Reproduction</div>
					
					<div class="worldText">In Nodd, there are no rigid biological laws governing what can and can't breed to make a hybrid. While this doesn’t mean everything can breed with everything else - while not well understood, there are still arcane laws to consider - it does mean even biologically incompatible pairings may be able to reproduce.</div>
					
					<div class="worldText">These mixed-species hybrids are known as chimerae. Many if not most insiders are chimerae. A chimera would legally be considered an insider - even if its parents are both outsiders - due to being formed within the city.</div>
					
					<div class="worldTitle">Juveniles</div>
					
					<div class="worldText">Nodd is not particularly accommodating of a family lifestyle, and juvenile citizens are largely left to fend for themselves. Often, orphans - called “gutter runts” or simply "runts" - will form gangs to protect themselves and other orphans until adulthood. They tend to make small townships on rooftops, inside the walls of buildings, and in other areas that see little to no foot traffic. Oftentimes the only easy way to access these places is through various pipes and other systems an adult of most species may not be able to squeeze through, hence the name.​</div>
					
					<div class="worldText">Runt gangs are hardly a force to be reckoned with, and are known for stealing from and exploiting their elders in various ways in order to survive.</div>
				</div>
				
				<div id="Beyond the City" class="tab" style="display:none">
					<div class="worldTitle">The Abyss</div>
					
					<div class="worldText">The Abyss is a general term applied to the area surrounding the City of Nodd. Much of the land closest to the city is occupied by windy plains and patches of dense forests and swamps.</div>
					
					<div class="worldText">There is no naturally occurring sun in Nodd. However, a powerful spell performed daily by the Council creates the illusion of a day and night cycle. This affects the city and the surrounding areas, but anything far beyond that becomes an impenetrable darkness.</div>
					
					<div class="worldText">Those who have tried to document the furthest reaches of the Abyss have either never returned, or inexplicably find themselves back at the city after months of travel. Stories involving travel of this magnitude often conflict in perplexing ways - each individual in a single party may return to report an entirely different experience, given they return at all.</div>
					
					<div class="worldText">Near the city, there are several smaller townships, villages, and outposts. Many of these are occupied by individuals who find Nodd too distasteful to be a part of, and those who seek solitude, safety, the thrill of the wilderness, or something else entirely. The presence of civilization diminishes the further you travel from Nodd.</div>
					
					<div class="worldText">As many strange and monstrous beasts roam the Abyss, competitive hunting is a common sport in Nodd, and hunters adorn their chambers with all manner of bizarre trophies.</div>
