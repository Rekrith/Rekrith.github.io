Water stain in the ceiling

00:01:59,717 --> 00:02:00,718

00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:53,226

00:03:38,264 --> 00:03:41,819
Joy: I'm just telling you now in case my mom says something dumb like you're...

00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,655
...fat, or whatever.

26
00:03:44,734 --> 00:03:47,257
Becky: I thought you said when she says shit like that it means she cares?

27
00:03:49,007 --> 00:03:49,820
Hi, Evelyn!

28
00:03:50,093 --> 00:03:50,874

00:03:53,953 --> 00:03:54,835
Now I have to cook more.

32
00:03:59,460 --> 00:03:59,952
It's Joy.

33
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:01,155

Evelyn: You know...

41
00:04:21,616 --> 00:04:22,695
He doesn't have to stay.

00:04:22,773 --> 00:04:23,843
Joy: Who's 'he'?

43
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,553
Evelyn: Becky!

44
00:04:24,679 --> 00:04:25,687
Joy: Becky's a 'she'.

45
00:04:26,249 --> 00:04:27,171
Evelyn: You know me!

46
00:04:27,196 --> 00:04:28,663
I always mix up 'he', 'she'.

47
00:04:28,688 --> 00:04:30,140
In Chinese? Just one word!

48
00:04:30,179 --> 00:04:31,327
'Ta'! So easy.

49
00:04:31,352 --> 00:04:32,772
And the way you two are dressed?

50
00:04:32,797 --> 00:04:34,897
I'm sure I'm not the only one calling him 'he'.

51
00:04:34,921 --> 00:04:35,999
...I mean her 'him'.

52
00:04:36,968 --> 00:04:37,546
Anyways!

53
00:04:37,609 --> 00:04:38,952
My English is f-fine.

54
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:40,288
And we have Google!

55
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,413
So you don't have to come and be a translator.

56
00:04:42,467 --> 00:04:42,780
Huh?

57
00:04:42,967 --> 00:04:45,092
You stay here, and she can go get-

58
00:04:45,163 --> 00:04:46,827
Joy: Look, I honestly think it's weird okay

59
00:04:46,852 --> 00:04:47,991
Now Becky <i>wants</i> to help

60
00:04:48,757 --> 00:04:49,421
Right, Becky?

61
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:52,702
Becky: I always learn something when I hang out with the elderly

62
00:04:52,727 --> 00:04:54,101
Old people are very wise.

63
00:04:54,226 --> 00:04:54,796
Evelyn: Hmm.

64
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:55,929
Evelyn: It's okay.

65
00:04:56,077 --> 00:04:57,905
We'll take Gong-gong with us to the meeting.

66
00:04:58,241 --> 00:05:00,296
Uh, you and Becky can stay here and decorate.

67
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,225
Becky: Where is he? When can I meet him?

68
00:05:06,398 --> 00:05:07,038
Joy: [Clears throat]

00:05:08,803 --> 00:05:10,014

70
00:05:10,155 --> 00:05:10,749
Evelyn: Customers!

71
00:05:10,976 --> 00:05:11,820
Eat. Fast!

72
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:19,264
Joy: Mom.

73
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:19,882
Evelyn: What?

74
00:05:19,913 --> 00:05:20,804
Joy: Mom, just wait.

75
00:05:21,265 --> 00:05:22,739
Evelyn: Wait? Wait, no time to wait today.

76
00:05:22,764 --> 00:05:23,654
Joy: Just, please
Evelyn: Wait? Wait, no time to wait today.

77
00:05:24,209 --> 00:05:27,294
Evelyn: Joy-a, any other time I beg you to come and eat.

78
00:05:27,748 --> 00:05:28,974
Or call me or <i>anything</i>

79
00:05:28,999 --> 00:05:30,099
but today very busy.

80
00:05:30,177 --> 00:05:31,232
Joy: Mom, this is literally what it's always like.

81
00:05:31,257 --> 00:05:32,865
Evelyn: Wrong white paint!
Joy: Mom, this is literally what it's always like.

82
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:34,724
Joy: Look, I know you haven't always liked Becky, okay

83
00:05:34,749 --> 00:05:36,763
Evelyn: I like Becky! She is very nice!

84
00:05:37,568 --> 00:05:39,685
You are very lucky--

85
00:05:45,044 --> 00:05:46,216
Joy: ...She's half Mexican...

86
00:05:52,013 --> 00:05:53,373
Evelyn: No shoes in washer!

87
00:05:53,489 --> 00:05:54,474
Broken? You pay-uh.

88
00:05:56,388 --> 00:05:57,154
But Gong-gong?

89
00:05:57,724 --> 00:05:59,123
His heart cannot take it!

90
00:05:59,148 --> 00:06:00,293
Especially after such a long flight!

91
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:02,426
You want him to come all the way from China to die like that?

92
00:06:02,451 --> 00:06:03,133
He's not gonna die!

93
00:06:03,158 --> 00:06:04,344
Big-nose: That's not what I said. What I said--
He's not gonna die!

94
00:06:06,946 --> 00:06:09,961
Big-nose: Just hold on. I can't hear you! Just hold on.
Evelyn: How can I help you?

95
00:06:10,227 --> 00:06:11,086
Evelyn: How can I help you?

96
00:06:11,119 --> 00:06:11,953
Big-nose: Yeah I'm here to pick up some shirts
Evelyn: How can I help you?

97
00:06:11,978 --> 00:06:12,797
I called like three times.

98
00:06:12,822 --> 00:06:14,891
Evelyn: Okay. Give me your ticket. I find for you.
I called like three times.

99
00:06:14,962 --> 00:06:16,094
Big-nose: No, I <i>have</i> the ticket!

100
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:18,703
She's just asking for it, that's like the way that it works.

101
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,344
They don't read minds.

102
00:06:21,352 --> 00:06:22,407
Then-then <i>hang up!</i>

103
00:06:22,432 --> 00:06:23,321
Thank you.

104
00:06:23,704 --> 00:06:25,297
Joy: We've been together for three years.

105
00:06:25,322 --> 00:06:27,087
Don't you think Gong-gong would want to know?

106
00:06:27,149 --> 00:06:28,876
Evelyn: Let him enjoy his party tonight!

107
00:06:29,938 --> 00:06:32,203
Joy: You think Becky is gonna get through the whole
party without introducing herself--

108
00:06:32,228 --> 00:06:33,766
Man: Evelyyyyn.
Joy: You think Becky is gonna get through the whole
party without introducing herself--

109
00:06:34,047 --> 00:06:37,055
Guess whose $20 got eaten by the machine again.

110
00:06:38,993 --> 00:06:41,290
Waymond! Customers need you!

111
00:06:41,315 --> 00:06:42,657
Waymond (muffled): Alright, coming!

112
00:06:42,682 --> 00:06:43,305
Man: Evelyn!

113
00:06:43,641 --> 00:06:47,508
You know my wife used to wear that exact same
perfume, god rest her soul?

114
00:06:47,533 --> 00:06:48,946
Evelyn: Are you coming to the party tonight?

115
00:06:48,971 --> 00:06:50,805
Man: Yeah! Got my ticket right here.

116
00:06:54,587 --> 00:06:57,633
Sorry! It was too crowded here so I moved
some upstairs.

117
00:06:57,946 --> 00:06:59,570
I think the clothes are happier there!

118
00:07:06,719 --> 00:07:08,462
Waymond: See? They're happier here!

119
00:07:14,626 --> 00:07:16,477
NO MORE GOOGLE EYES!

120
00:07:17,227 --> 00:07:18,837
Joy: Mom, can we <i>please</i> talk about Becky?

121
00:07:20,188 --> 00:07:22,274
Evelyn: I still don't know what his brain is thinking.

122
00:07:22,299 --> 00:07:24,126
Joy: Can Becky come tonight, or not?

123
00:07:24,151 --> 00:07:25,290
Evelyn: Stop changing the subject!

124
00:07:25,315 --> 00:07:25,906
Joy: I'm not--

125
00:07:25,931 --> 00:07:27,368
Evelyn: You know he's like our auditor.

126
00:07:27,393 --> 00:07:29,219
She is a <i>terrible</i> person!

127
00:07:29,508 --> 00:07:31,751
She keeps targetting the Chinese in the community.

128
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:35,618
You know two years of waiting?

129
00:07:35,643 --> 00:07:37,477
She puts a lien on our laundromat.

130
00:07:37,502 --> 00:07:38,782
And you know what your father does?

131
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:40,805
He brings her <i>cookies</i>.

132
00:07:44,704 --> 00:07:47,001
Every day, I fight, I fight, I fight for all of us.

133
00:07:48,587 --> 00:07:50,563
Every day is a battle here!

134
00:07:52,657 --> 00:07:55,290
Your father! He doesn't care about [inaudible]

135
00:07:59,532 --> 00:08:01,985
I try to make our lives easier and more simple.

136
00:08:15,344 --> 00:08:16,961
Waymond: Evelyn! You have to see Rick dance!

137
00:08:17,016 --> 00:08:18,774
Look, he knows all of the moves!

138
00:08:21,891 --> 00:08:24,086
Waymond: You know Rick is in community theatre?

139
00:08:24,415 --> 00:08:26,001
He wants to be an actor, just like you did!

140
00:08:51,602 --> 00:08:53,899
Waymond: Aah, I love this, hahaha!

141
00:08:57,376 --> 00:08:58,742
Joy: I know! I just- I just- I just

142
00:08:58,767 --> 00:09:00,242
I don't know how to be any fucking clearer!

143
00:09:00,267 --> 00:09:01,375
It's like, she can choose!

144
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,883
Either you come to the party with me

145
00:09:02,908 --> 00:09:05,531
And Gong-gong is eternally shamed until
he forgets it all

146
00:09:05,556 --> 00:09:06,288
And then he dies

147
00:09:06,313 --> 00:09:08,477
And then he dies
Or you <i>don't</i> come with me, and then he still dies!

148
00:09:08,502 --> 00:09:09,274
<i>What??</i>

149
00:09:11,469 --> 00:09:12,790
Evelyn: <i>What are you saying?</i>

150
00:09:12,837 --> 00:09:13,610
Joy: That was a joke.

151
00:09:14,407 --> 00:09:16,859
Waymond: That's not a very funny joke, honey!

152
00:09:17,133 --> 00:09:18,016
Becky: Hey guys...

153
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:20,428
Man: This is only $10.
I thought you people were very good with math.

154
00:09:20,453 --> 00:09:21,118
Evelyn: Next time I'll give you back

155
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:21,969
Waymond: Evelyn!
Evelyn: Next time I'll give you back

Evelyn: <i>WHAT?!</i>

160
00:10:03,594 --> 00:10:04,930
...Shit, how do you say it?

161
00:10:05,008 --> 00:10:05,578
Uh...

162
00:10:12,087 --> 00:10:13,071

Evelyn: Also!

165
00:10:33,906 --> 00:10:36,016
There is a Chinese new year party tonight!

166
00:10:36,172 --> 00:10:38,547
Open to all the customers in the community!

167
00:10:38,572 --> 00:10:41,625
Big-nose: Thank you. This is fine.

Evelyn: I get you an in- an invite

Joy!

173
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:47,087
Wait!

174
00:10:47,112 --> 00:10:47,797
Please!

175
00:10:48,071 --> 00:10:49,477
I have something to say to you!

176
00:10:49,977 --> 00:10:50,540
Joy: What?

177
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:00,149
You...

178
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:03,282
...you have to try and eat healthier.

179
00:11:05,157 --> 00:11:06,008
You are getting fat.

182
00:11:56,594 --> 00:11:57,149
Waymond: Evelyn?

183
00:12:00,422 --> 00:12:00,969
Evelyn?

184
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:14,613
[bwah]

185
00:12:26,368 --> 00:12:27,977
Evelyn: Go, go, go, go, go!

186
00:12:28,002 --> 00:12:28,377
Okay!

187
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:15,243
Evelyn: If I have to think of <i>one</i> more thing
today, my head will explode.

188
00:13:29,422 --> 00:13:30,969
Waymond: You may be in grave danger.

189
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:32,688
There's no time to explain.

190
00:13:32,719 --> 00:13:33,454
Hold this!

191
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:37,383
Evelyn: Why are you doing this--

192
00:13:37,696 --> 00:13:38,391
Waymond: Pay attention.

193
00:13:39,696 --> 00:13:40,953
Waymond: When we leave this elevator

194
00:13:40,978 --> 00:13:43,391
you can either turn left towards your scheduled
audit appointment OR

195
00:13:43,416 --> 00:13:45,729
you can turn right and go into the janitors' closet.

196
00:13:47,915 --> 00:13:49,203
Evelyn: Why would I go into the janitors'--

197
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:50,071
Waymond: Not now.
Evelyn: Why would I go into the janitors'--

198
00:13:52,734 --> 00:13:56,329
Evelyn: Ai, oh! Why you download all these
apps on my phone?

199
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:01,415
Waymond: Breathe in. You're gonna
feel a slight pressure in your head.

200
00:15:02,407 --> 00:15:03,891
Evelyn: Hey, baby Joy!

201
00:15:05,243 --> 00:15:06,515
Evelyn: You come back here!

202
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,547
Evelyn: You come back here!
Joy: Shut. Up.

203
00:15:07,617 --> 00:15:09,266
Evelyn: You don't talk to your mother like this!

204
00:15:21,305 --> 00:15:22,852
Waymond: The moment you're situated
in your meeting

205
00:15:23,094 --> 00:15:24,422
follow these instructions.

206
00:15:25,735 --> 00:15:26,540
But remember.

207
00:15:26,664 --> 00:15:27,719
No one can know.

208
00:15:28,047 --> 00:15:30,524
Don't even talk to me about this because I
won't remember.

209
00:15:30,883 --> 00:15:32,602
Evelyn: But I- I don't-
Waymond: Shh.

<i>Device: Mental scan complete</i>

211
00:15:45,782 --> 00:15:46,696
Waymond: Talk to you soon.

212
00:16:22,243 --> 00:16:23,141
Mrs. Wang.

213
00:16:24,805 --> 00:16:26,344
Auditor: Mrs. Wang, are you with us?

214
00:16:28,305 --> 00:16:28,914
Yes.

215
00:16:30,774 --> 00:16:31,281
Of course.

216
00:16:31,306 --> 00:16:31,883
I'm here!

217
00:16:32,016 --> 00:16:32,829
Just thinking.

218
00:16:32,907 --> 00:16:34,086
Oh, okay. Well,

219
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:36,337
I was just hoping

220
00:16:37,376 --> 00:16:38,938
that you could explain this.

221
00:16:44,524 --> 00:16:45,735
Evelyn: This is a receipt.

222
00:16:47,602 --> 00:16:48,235
My receipt.

223
00:16:53,344 --> 00:16:54,110
Auditor: I-- look.

224
00:16:54,969 --> 00:16:57,172
I was just hoping you could enlighten me.

225
00:16:57,899 --> 00:17:00,289
As to how, as a laundromat owner

226
00:17:01,219 --> 00:17:02,485
a karaoke machine

227
00:17:02,774 --> 00:17:04,868
could constitute a business expense.

228
00:17:04,993 --> 00:17:05,844
Evelyn: I am a...

229
00:17:06,196 --> 00:17:06,844
singer.

230
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:08,391
[sighs]

231
00:17:08,977 --> 00:17:09,739
Auditor: Of course you are.

232
00:17:09,763 --> 00:17:10,625
Waymond: It's true!

233
00:17:10,774 --> 00:17:12,118
She has a beautiful voice!

234
00:17:13,204 --> 00:17:14,719
Evelyn! Sing a song for her!

235
00:17:15,774 --> 00:17:18,883
Auditor: No, no! Please, that will
not be necessary, but

236
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:22,977
I will need a separate Schedule C
for each

237
00:17:23,243 --> 00:17:25,118
of these businesses because

238
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,743
based on what you're trying to deduct

239
00:17:27,883 --> 00:17:28,883
you're also a

240
00:17:28,908 --> 00:17:29,852
novellist

241
00:17:30,641 --> 00:17:31,376
and a chef

242
00:17:31,401 --> 00:17:33,094
Evelyn: Last time you <i>told</i> me

243
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:34,453
Auditor: No, that-- p-- please.

244
00:17:35,016 --> 00:17:35,899
a teacher

245
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:37,680
uh

246
00:17:37,797 --> 00:17:38,438
and

247
00:17:38,469 --> 00:17:39,735
a singing coach, an

248
00:17:40,555 --> 00:17:42,281
a watsu technician

249
00:17:42,306 --> 00:17:42,875
I'm sorry

250
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:43,313
what

251
00:17:43,969 --> 00:17:44,227
what

252
00:17:44,368 --> 00:17:45,196
what is watsu

253
00:17:46,626 --> 00:17:47,532
Waymond: It's a water massage

254
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:54,430
(muffled) For back pain, you go get water massage

255
00:18:17,922 --> 00:18:18,462
[beep]

256
00:18:52,063 --> 00:18:53,422
What's happening?

257
00:18:54,157 --> 00:18:55,352
Auditor: --like I'm talking to my ex husband.

258
00:18:56,555 --> 00:18:58,258
Like I said to you before--

259
00:18:59,696 --> 00:19:01,075
It's <i>you</i> messing with my head!

260
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:01,782
Waymond: Shh!

261
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:02,789
Evelyn: Don't shh me!

262
00:19:02,814 --> 00:19:03,820
Waymond: Try and match your body.

263
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:05,887
Evelyn: [muffled screaming]

264
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:06,821
Waymond: Calm down, please!

265
00:19:06,915 --> 00:19:07,930
Calm down!

266
00:19:08,555 --> 00:19:10,359
Relax your body in the other universe.

267
00:19:10,384 --> 00:19:10,852
Please.

268
00:19:13,532 --> 00:19:14,962
Waymond: Go into autopilot.

269
00:19:19,016 --> 00:19:20,344
Good... Good.

270
00:19:21,219 --> 00:19:23,422
They don't know you and I
are in this universe yet.

271
00:19:23,633 --> 00:19:25,532
So hopefully, I'll have some time
to explain.

272
00:19:25,782 --> 00:19:26,821
I'm not your husband

273
00:19:26,946 --> 00:19:28,110
at least, not the one you know

274
00:19:28,454 --> 00:19:29,617
I'm another <i>version</i> of him

275
00:19:29,642 --> 00:19:30,575
from another life path

276
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:31,509
- another <i>universe</i>

277
00:19:31,883 --> 00:19:33,782
I'm here because we need your help!

278
00:19:35,305 --> 00:19:36,461
Evelyn: Very busy today!

279
00:19:36,486 --> 00:19:37,705
No time to help you!

280
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:41,532
Waymond: There's a great evil
that has taken root in my world

281
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:44,282
and it's begun spreading its chaos
throughout the many verses

282
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:45,680
I've spent <i>years</i>

283
00:19:45,705 --> 00:19:46,712
searching for the one

284
00:19:46,737 --> 00:19:48,524
who might be the match
to this great evil

285
00:19:48,704 --> 00:19:50,070
with an even greater good

286
00:19:50,095 --> 00:19:51,087
and bring back balance!

287
00:19:51,703 --> 00:19:54,000
All those years of searching
have brought me here.

288
00:19:54,033 --> 00:19:54,429
(muffled) Mrs. Wang?

289
00:19:54,454 --> 00:19:55,508
To this universe.
(muffled) Mrs. Wang?

290
00:19:56,016 --> 00:19:56,610
To you.
(Muffled) Hello?

291
00:19:56,891 --> 00:19:58,454
I know it's a lot to take in right now
Auditor: Mrs. Wang?

292
00:19:58,899 --> 00:20:00,016
MRS. WANG.

293
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:00,977
Hellooo?

294
00:20:02,704 --> 00:20:03,344
Look, I-

295
00:20:03,704 --> 00:20:05,063
I'm sure you have a lot on your mind

296
00:20:05,102 --> 00:20:05,579
But I-

297
00:20:05,969 --> 00:20:08,415
cannot imagine anything mattering more

298
00:20:09,157 --> 00:20:09,860
than the

299
00:20:10,282 --> 00:20:12,133
conversation we are now having

300
00:20:12,251 --> 00:20:13,868
concerning your tax liability.

301
00:20:14,516 --> 00:20:14,962
I-

302
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,227
need I remind you

303
00:20:16,252 --> 00:20:18,102
that there's already a lien on your property

304
00:20:18,297 --> 00:20:20,047
Repossession is well within our rights

305
00:20:20,072 --> 00:20:20,641
Evelyn: I know.
Repossession is well within our rights

306
00:20:21,297 --> 00:20:22,727
I am paying attention.

307
00:20:28,016 --> 00:20:29,071
Auditor: Do you see these?

308
00:20:31,977 --> 00:20:33,243
<i>You don't get one of these</i>

309
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:35,797
<i>unless you've seen a lot of bullshit.</i>

310
00:20:36,126 --> 00:20:37,610
<i>Excuse my French</i>

311
00:20:38,563 --> 00:20:39,813
Now you may

312
00:20:40,016 --> 00:20:42,571
only see a pile of boring forms and numbers

313
00:20:43,337 --> 00:20:44,462
but I see a <i>story</i>

314
00:20:46,477 --> 00:20:47,696
With nothing

315
00:20:48,352 --> 00:20:49,469
but a stack of receipts

316
00:20:49,494 --> 00:20:52,711
I can trace the ups and downs of your life

317
00:20:54,751 --> 00:20:56,305
And it does not look good.

318
00:20:57,922 --> 00:20:59,165
It does not

319
00:20:59,626 --> 00:21:00,126
look

320
00:21:00,587 --> 00:21:01,391
good.

321
00:21:04,688 --> 00:21:05,352
Waymond: Sorry.

322
00:21:05,852 --> 00:21:08,274
My wife confuses her hobbies for businesses.

323
00:21:08,813 --> 00:21:10,212
An honest mistake!

324
00:21:12,516 --> 00:21:13,305
Auditor: ...Okay.

325
00:21:14,422 --> 00:21:14,852
Well.

326
00:21:15,032 --> 00:21:16,719
With all of these, um...

327
00:21:18,922 --> 00:21:20,501
"Honest mistakes", I mean

328
00:21:20,526 --> 00:21:22,055
even if we don't charge you with

329
00:21:22,985 --> 00:21:23,891
<i>fraud,</i> we'll

330
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:26,579
most certainly have to fine you for

331
00:21:27,087 --> 00:21:28,212
gross neglicence.

332
00:21:29,102 --> 00:21:31,204
Evelyn: You always trying to confuse us with these...

333
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:32,454
big words.

334
00:21:34,016 --> 00:21:35,360
Auditor: I. Thought. You. Were.

335
00:21:35,385 --> 00:21:37,883
Going. To. Bring. Your. Daughter

336
00:21:38,219 --> 00:21:38,891
to help

337
00:21:39,063 --> 00:21:40,438
you translate.

338
00:21:40,743 --> 00:21:42,266
Evelyn: I AM going to bring my-

339
00:21:42,297 --> 00:21:43,305
Sorry

340
00:21:43,793 --> 00:21:44,270
Evelyn

341
00:21:45,899 --> 00:21:46,493
Waymond: Evelyn!

342
00:21:46,518 --> 00:21:47,618
Are you paying attention?

343
00:21:47,735 --> 00:21:49,024
Evelyn: I cannot talk now!

344
00:21:50,297 --> 00:21:52,040
Unless you can help me with my taxes?

345
00:21:52,696 --> 00:21:53,977
What is "gross necklaces?"

346
00:21:54,071 --> 00:21:56,008
Waymond: I <i>know</i> you have a lot
of things on your mind.

347
00:21:56,297 --> 00:21:57,999
But nothing could possibly matter more

348
00:21:58,024 --> 00:22:00,008
than <i>this</i> conversation we're having
right now

349
00:22:00,033 --> 00:22:01,836
concerning the fate of <i>every</i> single world

350
00:22:01,861 --> 00:22:03,305
of our <i>infinite</i> multiverse

351
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,141
(muffled) No respect for my...

352
00:22:08,469 --> 00:22:09,657
Waymond: My dear Evelyn...

353
00:22:10,477 --> 00:22:11,360
I know you.

354
00:22:12,055 --> 00:22:14,156
With every passing moment you fear

355
00:22:14,181 --> 00:22:16,805
you might have missed your chance
to make something of your life

356
00:22:17,735 --> 00:22:18,758
I'm here to tell you

357
00:22:19,555 --> 00:22:20,805
Every rejection

358
00:22:21,446 --> 00:22:22,610
Every disappointment

359
00:22:22,938 --> 00:22:23,860
has led you here

360
00:22:24,751 --> 00:22:26,071
to <i>this</i> moment

361
00:22:27,399 --> 00:22:29,571
don't let <i>anything</i> distract you from it

362
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:38,547
Auditor: Do you think
this is funny?

363
00:22:42,351 --> 00:22:43,195
Waymond: So what will it be?

364
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,790

00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:04,982
Evelyn: Like... you

551
00:35:05,007 --> 00:35:05,665
with the

552
00:35:06,084 --> 00:35:06,623
fanny pack?

553
00:35:07,162 --> 00:35:07,896
Alpha Waymond: Exactly

554
00:35:08,255 --> 00:35:10,216
It's called Verse Jumping

555
00:35:10,841 --> 00:35:12,290
and I need you to
learn how to do it

556
00:35:12,314 --> 00:35:13,084
Right now

557
00:35:13,537 --> 00:35:14,748
Evelyn: Right now?!

558
00:35:16,005 --> 00:35:18,724
Alpha Waymond: It may be our
only chance of getting out of here alive!

559
00:35:24,919 --> 00:35:25,427
[beep]

560
00:35:29,545 --> 00:35:31,091
Two guards coming this way

561
00:35:31,201 --> 00:35:32,779
On my signal, try to blend in

562
00:35:35,334 --> 00:35:37,740
Why don't you get YOU
Evelyn to do this?

563
00:35:38,701 --> 00:35:39,748
Alpha Waymond:
My Evelyn is dead.

564
00:35:40,732 --> 00:35:41,091
<i>Go!</i>

565
00:35:41,435 --> 00:35:42,232
Alpha Waymond:
OH MY GOD!

566
00:35:42,382 --> 00:35:42,767
Alpha Waymond:
OH MY GOD!

567
00:35:42,791 --> 00:35:43,365
WHAT'S GOING ON?!

568
00:35:43,427 --> 00:35:44,052
Help us!

569
00:35:44,334 --> 00:35:45,021
Help us!

570
00:35:54,427 --> 00:35:55,638
Evelyn: How did I die?

571
00:35:56,209 --> 00:35:57,755
Alpha Waymond:
I've seen you die a thousand ways

572
00:35:58,091 --> 00:35:59,545
In a thousand worlds

573
00:36:00,677 --> 00:36:01,826
In every single one

574
00:36:02,404 --> 00:36:03,412
you were murdered.

575
00:36:03,576 --> 00:36:04,154
Evelyn: What?!

576
00:36:04,193 --> 00:36:06,013
Why would anybody
want to kill me?!

577
00:36:06,154 --> 00:36:07,283
Alpha Waymond:
She's an omniversal being

578
00:36:07,307 --> 00:36:08,529
with unimaginable power

579
00:36:08,966 --> 00:36:10,349
an agent of pure chaos

580
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,193
with no real motives or desires

581
00:36:13,388 --> 00:36:14,443
<i>Jobu Tupaki</i>

582
00:36:14,834 --> 00:36:16,193
Evelyn: You're just
making up sounds!

583
00:36:20,607 --> 00:36:21,607
We need another exit.

584
00:36:23,927 --> 00:36:25,415
Evelyn: So let her
destroy the other bubbles.

585
00:36:25,439 --> 00:36:26,974
You said there are so many of them!

586
00:36:27,716 --> 00:36:29,142
Maybe it's okay if
we lose some

587
00:36:29,166 --> 00:36:29,692
but just

588
00:36:29,963 --> 00:36:30,998
leave me out of it

589
00:36:34,201 --> 00:36:35,380
Alpha Waymond:
It's not so simple.

590
00:36:38,865 --> 00:36:40,216
She's been building something.

591
00:36:41,545 --> 00:36:43,412
We thought it was some
sort of black hole

592
00:36:44,255 --> 00:36:46,361
But it appears to
consume more than just

593
00:36:46,385 --> 00:36:47,365
light and matter

594
00:36:48,287 --> 00:36:49,873
We don't know exactly
what it is

595
00:36:50,435 --> 00:36:51,810
We don't know what it's for

596
00:36:52,607 --> 00:36:53,857
But we can all...

597
00:36:54,451 --> 00:36:55,044
<i>feel</i> it

598
00:36:56,412 --> 00:36:58,185
You've been feeling it, too
haven't you?

599
00:36:58,755 --> 00:36:59,920
Something is off

600
00:37:00,576 --> 00:37:02,795
Your clothes never wear as
well the next day

601
00:37:03,724 --> 00:37:05,795
Your hair never falls
in quite the same way

602
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,255
Even your coffee tastes...

603
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:10,013
<i>wrong.</i>

604
00:37:11,966 --> 00:37:13,904
Our institutions are crumbling

605
00:37:14,826 --> 00:37:15,373
Nobody...

606
00:37:15,568 --> 00:37:16,943
trusts their neighbour anymore

607
00:37:17,771 --> 00:37:19,693
And you stay up at night
wondering to yourself

608
00:37:19,718 --> 00:37:20,904
Evelyn: How can we get back?

609
00:37:24,396 --> 00:37:24,880
Alpha Waymond:
This

610
00:37:25,373 --> 00:37:26,630
is the Alpha Verse mission

611
00:37:27,529 --> 00:37:29,505
To take us back to
how it's supposed to be

612
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:32,373
But that begins with
finding the one

613
00:37:32,864 --> 00:37:34,017
who can stand up to Jobu's

614
00:37:34,041 --> 00:37:35,537
perverse shard of chaos

615
00:37:37,349 --> 00:37:38,349
Evelyn: And you think
it's <i>me?</i>

616
00:37:39,959 --> 00:37:41,431
Alpha Waymond:
Why else would we risk <i>everything</i>

617
00:37:41,455 --> 00:37:42,287
to get you out of here?

618
00:37:52,865 --> 00:37:53,599
Oh...

619
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:55,536
There you are.

620
00:37:55,561 --> 00:37:55,998
Oh!

621
00:37:56,545 --> 00:37:57,685
Evelyn: Ms. Dierdre!

622
00:37:58,154 --> 00:37:58,568
I'm-

623
00:37:58,724 --> 00:37:59,935
sorry I punched you, but-

624
00:38:01,474 --> 00:38:01,873
Look

625
00:38:02,302 --> 00:38:04,050
I think I finally understand

626
00:38:04,075 --> 00:38:04,489
why-

627
00:38:04,636 --> 00:38:05,106
[gasps]

628
00:38:07,349 --> 00:38:08,341
What is she doing?!

629
00:38:08,779 --> 00:38:10,224
Alpha Waymond:
Verse jumping. Run!

630
00:38:11,162 --> 00:38:11,685
[beep]

631
00:38:15,037 --> 00:38:16,404
[screams in IRS]

632
00:38:28,474 --> 00:38:30,138
She jumped somewhere. Brute force.

633
00:38:30,177 --> 00:38:31,857
Sumo wrestler? Body builder?

634
00:38:31,882 --> 00:38:32,537
Doesn't matter.

635
00:38:32,857 --> 00:38:33,912
Counter with someone agile!

636
00:38:33,997 --> 00:38:35,376
On your perimeter we've got

637
00:38:35,401 --> 00:38:36,092
a break dancer

638
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,068

639
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:37,763
gymnast

640
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:38,646
Give me gymnast. Go!

641
00:38:38,724 --> 00:38:39,888
Calculating route...

642
00:38:42,732 --> 00:38:43,790
Okay, so papercuts.

643
00:38:43,814 --> 00:38:44,204
Four of them!

644
00:38:44,228 --> 00:38:45,084
One between each finger.

645
00:38:49,566 --> 00:38:51,546
Papercuts won't
happen when you- I'm trying!

646
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:52,474
It's impossible

647
00:38:52,652 --> 00:38:54,620
Probability one in eight thousand

648
00:38:54,691 --> 00:38:56,965
It's the strongest
jumping path we have.

649
00:38:59,605 --> 00:39:00,152
What you doing?

650
00:39:08,176 --> 00:39:09,230
There we go. One!

651
00:39:11,652 --> 00:39:12,465
There's two

652
00:39:16,449 --> 00:39:16,917
Three!

653
00:39:16,941 --> 00:39:18,249
A'ight come on come on come on

654
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:18,855
Stay with me

655
00:39:30,839 --> 00:39:31,902
FOUR! There it is!

656
00:39:31,927 --> 00:39:32,801
Okay c'mon, jump!

657
00:39:42,808 --> 00:39:44,551
Is that... pro wrestling?

658
00:39:45,761 --> 00:39:47,144
She's going for
a back breaker!

659
00:40:17,222 --> 00:40:18,152
She's gotta run

660
00:40:18,177 --> 00:40:19,410
No! She can jump

661
00:40:19,754 --> 00:40:20,691
<i>Somewhere,</i> she can fight

662
00:40:20,808 --> 00:40:21,792
She's not ready

663
00:40:21,918 --> 00:40:23,660
A jump like that would
fry most people

664
00:40:25,261 --> 00:40:26,683
She's not most people.

665
00:40:30,465 --> 00:40:30,863
Damn!

666
00:40:31,034 --> 00:40:31,926
What a weak body

667
00:40:42,168 --> 00:40:42,582
Hello?

668
00:40:42,777 --> 00:40:43,418
Alpha Waymond:
Evelyn

669
00:40:43,558 --> 00:40:44,191
Can you hear me?

670
00:40:45,198 --> 00:40:46,574
You're gonna have to
verse jump

671
00:40:46,808 --> 00:40:48,058
Verse jump?!

672
00:40:59,261 --> 00:40:59,652
Hello?

673
00:41:00,277 --> 00:41:01,437
Concentrate on a universe

674
00:41:01,461 --> 00:41:03,301
in which you
studied martial arts

675
00:41:11,144 --> 00:41:12,480
Okay, I'm locking in

676
00:41:14,621 --> 00:41:16,066
<i>Calculations complete.</i>

677
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,285
<i>Profess your love.</i>

678
00:41:19,316 --> 00:41:21,254
Alpha Waymond:
You're gonna have to profess
your love to Dierdre

679
00:41:22,129 --> 00:41:22,699
<i>No way!</i>

680
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:23,871
Alpha Waymond:
It's your jumping path!

681
00:41:24,425 --> 00:41:25,515
It's like eating the chapstick

682
00:41:25,539 --> 00:41:26,676
or switching shoes

683
00:41:26,902 --> 00:41:28,257
We developed an algorithm

684
00:41:28,281 --> 00:41:29,781
that calculates which statistically

685
00:41:29,805 --> 00:41:31,406
improbable action will place you

686
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:32,429
in the universe on the edge

687
00:41:32,453 --> 00:41:33,676
of your local cluster

688
00:41:33,801 --> 00:41:35,039
which then slingshots you

689
00:41:35,063 --> 00:41:36,722
to the desired universe

690
00:41:36,972 --> 00:41:38,090
Evelyn: Stupid!

691
00:41:38,222 --> 00:41:39,433
Doesn't make any sense!

692
00:41:39,863 --> 00:41:40,613
Alpha Waymond:
<i>Exactly!</i>

693
00:41:41,691 --> 00:41:42,585
The less sense it makes

694
00:41:42,609 --> 00:41:43,035
the better

695
00:41:43,566 --> 00:41:46,753
The stochastic pass algorithm's
fuelled by random actions

696
00:41:47,197 --> 00:41:48,190
Tell her you love her

697
00:41:48,308 --> 00:41:48,971
and <i>mean</i> it!

698
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,683
Are there <i>any other</i> jumping paths?

699
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:55,011
The next best paths are
break your own arm

700
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:56,090
or take a nap

701
00:41:56,488 --> 00:41:57,590
You're not sleepy, are you?

702
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,449
I love you?

703
00:42:03,965 --> 00:42:05,121

No, no, no!

709
00:42:20,378 --> 00:42:21,371
She's gone home

710

...to finish her taxes.

711
00:42:46,832 --> 00:42:48,426
This doesn't make any sense...

712
00:42:49,129 --> 00:42:50,004
Think about it

713
00:42:53,551 --> 00:42:54,965
You always get pulled away

I'm sorry, Evelyn

717
00:43:11,566 --> 00:43:12,449
I need to go.

718
00:43:13,035 --> 00:43:13,550
What?

719
00:43:13,902 --> 00:43:15,535
I need to find the right Evelyn.

720
00:43:16,347 --> 00:43:17,504
And this one...

721
00:43:18,574 --> 00:43:19,621
It's not the one.

00:43:19,801 --> 00:43:20,176
No!

No!

00:43:20,576 --> 00:43:20,918
Wait!

725
00:43:20,988 --> 00:43:22,120
Let me try again!

Go, go, go go!

00:43:49,347 --> 00:43:50,566
You just left me!

I love you!

739
00:44:52,827 --> 00:44:54,976
[choral chanting]
<i>I love you, I love you...</i>

740
00:45:05,754 --> 00:45:06,480
I...

741
00:45:06,715 --> 00:45:07,433
love...

742
00:45:07,495 --> 00:45:08,160
you...

743
00:45:09,293 --> 00:45:10,129
[successful beep]

744
00:45:14,851 --> 00:45:15,647
<i>I...</i>

745
00:45:15,804 --> 00:45:16,710
<i>Love...</i>

746
00:45:38,090 --> 00:45:38,839
Evelyn?

747
00:46:13,879 --> 00:46:16,245
Evelyn: Oh, I'm so happy
to be here today

748
00:46:16,793 --> 00:46:17,347
Evelyn?

749
00:46:18,707 --> 00:46:19,339
Evelyn?!

750
00:47:16,293 --> 00:47:17,199
Why did you-

751
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:18,043
How-

752
00:47:30,746 --> 00:47:31,801
It was <i>beautiful!</i>

753
00:47:44,676 --> 00:47:45,331
Waymond...

754
00:47:47,465 --> 00:47:48,394
Alpha Waymond:
We better keep moving.

755
00:47:48,933 --> 00:47:50,710
Now you've <i>definitely</i>
got Jobu's attention

756
00:47:50,734 --> 00:47:51,410
Come on!

757
00:48:03,668 --> 00:48:04,324
Stay calm!

758
00:48:05,324 --> 00:48:07,668
Your brain is under an
incredible amount of stress

759
00:48:08,855 --> 00:48:10,566
Evelyn: Let me finish talking with my husband

760
00:48:11,168 --> 00:48:12,066
He needs to know

761
00:48:12,091 --> 00:48:13,824
how good my life could have been

762
00:48:22,183 --> 00:48:23,043
Are you with me?

763
00:48:24,496 --> 00:48:25,933
Evelyn: I thought I was disconnected?

764
00:48:26,566 --> 00:48:27,879
Why was I still there?

765
00:48:27,972 --> 00:48:28,590
Alpha Waymond:
Your mind

766
00:48:29,027 --> 00:48:30,582
is like a clay pot holding water

767
00:48:30,972 --> 00:48:33,738
every jump opens another crack
causing things to leak through

768
00:48:34,222 --> 00:48:35,035
With training

769
00:48:35,097 --> 00:48:36,785
you will learn to reseal these cracks

770
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:39,222
Eat.

771
00:48:39,449 --> 00:48:40,355
You need energy.

772
00:48:43,261 --> 00:48:44,379
Cream cheese...

773
00:48:46,676 --> 00:48:47,504
<i>Mmm!</i>

774
00:48:48,652 --> 00:48:49,613
In my universe

775
00:48:49,769 --> 00:48:51,129
the cattle were killed off

776
00:48:51,605 --> 00:48:52,765
one of the many things we lost

777
00:48:52,789 --> 00:48:54,066
in our war against Jobu

778
00:48:59,168 --> 00:48:59,691
Evelyn: What if...

779
00:49:01,426 --> 00:49:02,668
What if I wanna go back?

780
00:49:04,230 --> 00:49:06,472
What if I wanna go back
to the other universe?

781
00:49:06,933 --> 00:49:07,785
Alpha Waymond:
<i>SHUT IT DOWN!</i>

782
00:49:07,988 --> 00:49:09,082
<i>Shut it down, you hear me?!</i>

783
00:49:09,222 --> 00:49:09,777
<i>Come back!</i>

784
00:49:09,972 --> 00:49:11,160
Evelyn: Okay, okay, okay!

785
00:49:11,433 --> 00:49:12,551
I'm b- I'm back!

786
00:49:15,183 --> 00:49:15,715
Alpha Waymond:
Listen.

787
00:49:16,215 --> 00:49:19,496
You are only using the other worlds to
acquire special skills, you understand?

788
00:49:19,949 --> 00:49:22,660
If you fall for the temptations,
you invite contradictions

789
00:49:22,699 --> 00:49:23,355
<i>Chaos!</i>

790
00:49:23,933 --> 00:49:25,965
The clay pot could shatter
and you could die

791
00:49:26,652 --> 00:49:28,019
Or far worse...

792
00:49:29,574 --> 00:49:30,879
Evelyn: What can be
worse than <i>death?</i>

793
00:49:33,465 --> 00:49:34,711
We should get moving until we can-

794
00:49:34,735 --> 00:49:35,903
Evelyn: No, no, no!
We should get moving until we can-

795
00:49:36,746 --> 00:49:37,738
Enough of your

796
00:49:37,785 --> 00:49:38,590
clay pots

797
00:49:38,621 --> 00:49:40,261
cream cheese, no cows

798
00:49:41,097 --> 00:49:42,449
Explain it all to me.

799
00:49:42,566 --> 00:49:43,105
Now!

800
00:49:48,574 --> 00:49:49,176
Alpha Waymond:
You're right.

801
00:49:51,527 --> 00:49:52,636
In the Alpha Verse...

802
00:49:53,129 --> 00:49:55,433
we began training many young minds
to verse jump

803
00:49:56,590 --> 00:49:58,980
but there was one who was
far and above the most gifted

804
00:49:59,683 --> 00:50:01,019
Our little explorer.

805
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:03,261
You saw her potential

806
00:50:03,949 --> 00:50:04,972
so you pushed her.

807
00:50:05,933 --> 00:50:06,926
Beyond her limit.

808
00:50:08,175 --> 00:50:10,074
<i>Warning! Unstable!</i>

809
00:50:10,894 --> 00:50:11,418
[beep]

810
00:50:11,831 --> 00:50:13,910
Though overloaded mind usually dies

811
00:50:14,246 --> 00:50:15,043
instead...

812
00:50:15,152 --> 00:50:16,293
her mind was fractured

813
00:50:17,074 --> 00:50:18,551
<i>Warning! Unstable!</i>

814
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:20,793
<i>Mind fracturing...</i>

815
00:50:24,543 --> 00:50:25,183
Now?

816
00:50:25,496 --> 00:50:27,504
Her mind experiences every world...

817
00:50:28,215 --> 00:50:29,371
...every possibility...

818
00:50:30,090 --> 00:50:31,519
...at the same exact time...

819
00:50:31,871 --> 00:50:33,988
...commanding the infinite knowledge and power

820
00:50:34,013 --> 00:50:35,426
...of the multiverse.

821
00:50:36,168 --> 00:50:37,511
Now she's seen too much

822
00:50:37,675 --> 00:50:39,207
Lost any sense of morality

823
00:50:39,293 --> 00:50:40,629
Any belief in objective truth

824
00:50:41,683 --> 00:50:42,879
Evelyn: What does she want?

825
00:50:44,152 --> 00:50:45,105
Alpha Waymond:
No one knows.

826
00:50:46,426 --> 00:50:47,558
All we know

827
00:50:48,074 --> 00:50:49,301
is she's looking for <i>you.</i>

828
00:50:54,386 --> 00:50:54,894
Hey

829
00:50:55,551 --> 00:50:57,097
You said I was the wrong one

830
00:50:58,004 --> 00:50:59,105
Alpha Waymond:
What you did back there

831
00:50:59,629 --> 00:51:00,738
It changed my mind

832
00:51:01,941 --> 00:51:02,527
You...

833
00:51:02,668 --> 00:51:03,746
were incredible.

834
00:51:39,979 --> 00:51:40,862
Evelyn: Waymond...

835
00:52:06,478 --> 00:52:07,580
Of course.

836
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:27,066
Evelyn! Come back!

837
00:52:27,379 --> 00:52:27,980
Evelyn!

838
00:52:28,005 --> 00:52:29,308
Jump to another combat universe!

839
00:52:29,333 --> 00:52:31,519
Try peeing yourself, it's
always a good jumping pattern!

840
00:52:35,418 --> 00:52:36,511
C'mon, wake up!

841
00:52:36,879 --> 00:52:37,386
Wake up!

842
00:52:37,715 --> 00:52:39,355
Dierdre: What did you do to me?

843
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:42,496
Did you staple something to my forehead?!

844
00:52:42,668 --> 00:52:44,156
Evelyn: I didn't do anything!
Guard: We got movement on the elevator

845
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:45,402
Evelyn: You did it yourself!
Guard: Did we call for backup?

846
00:52:45,427 --> 00:52:46,527
Dierdre: I did not do this to myself!

847
00:52:48,535 --> 00:52:49,965
Police: We detained the assailants

848
00:52:50,121 --> 00:52:51,269
No backup was requested.

849
00:52:51,871 --> 00:52:53,644
You guys are wasting a trip up. Copy?

850
00:52:55,371 --> 00:52:56,230
Alpha Waymond:
Oh no...

851
00:52:57,199 --> 00:52:58,097
She found us.

852
00:52:59,136 --> 00:53:00,402
Police: I said, do you copy?

853
00:53:04,605 --> 00:53:05,301
Clear 'em.

854
00:53:30,136 --> 00:53:30,800
Evelyn: Joy?

855
00:53:31,683 --> 00:53:33,051
Why do you look so stupid?

856
00:53:33,113 --> 00:53:33,761
Police: Ma'am.

857
00:53:35,644 --> 00:53:36,465
You and...

00:53:36,793 --> 00:53:37,707
...your pig...

859
00:53:38,051 --> 00:53:38,832
...can't be here.

860
00:53:45,754 --> 00:53:47,308
Is it that I can't

861
00:53:48,199 --> 00:53:49,176
be here?

862
00:53:52,066 --> 00:53:53,855
...Or that I'm not <i>allowed</i>

863
00:53:54,238 --> 00:53:55,301
to be here?

864
00:53:56,652 --> 00:53:57,269
Police: Okay.

865
00:53:58,894 --> 00:53:59,226

Hands where I can see 'em.

physically be here.

868
00:54:04,402 --> 00:54:05,660
But what you <i>meant</i> to say

869
00:54:05,685 --> 00:54:06,465
is you're not

870
00:54:06,535 --> 00:54:07,683
allowing me

871
00:54:07,910 --> 00:54:08,715

Police: Yeah, sure kid

877
00:54:19,978 --> 00:54:21,091
I can't let you do that either

Jobu: Again with the <i>CAN'T!</i>

See, I don't think you understand

880
00:54:27,044 --> 00:54:28,755
the meaning of that word

881
00:54:40,490 --> 00:54:42,169
See I <i>can</i> walk through you.

Don't engage!

You're the reason

my daughter doesn't call any more!

905
00:56:34,083 --> 00:56:35,833
Why she dropped out of college!

906
00:56:36,130 --> 00:56:37,333

You're still hung up on
the fact

that I like girls

915

in this world?

Evelyn: Go!

1293
01:16:54,754 --> 01:16:55,161
Evelyn-

1294
01:16:55,411 --> 01:16:57,590
If you don't step up I'm giving some of your shifts to Chad

1295
01:17:02,044 --> 01:17:02,856
Chad: [chef wink]

1296
01:18:05,661 --> 01:18:06,442
Waymond: Huh? What happened?

1297
01:18:06,958 --> 01:18:08,207
Joy: I think they lost their...

1298
01:18:08,829 --> 01:18:09,825
Powers?

1299
01:18:11,044 --> 01:18:11,778
Man: Sir?

1300
01:18:12,950 --> 01:18:14,356
I'm gonna need another jumping pad.

1301
01:18:22,309 --> 01:18:23,004
[horrified realisation]

1302
01:18:23,958 --> 01:18:25,333
Waymond: I think she needs to
do something weird again!

1303
01:18:25,358 --> 01:18:26,044
Joy: What's he doing?
Waymond: I think she needs to
do something weird again!

1304
01:18:37,825 --> 01:18:39,473
Joy: Oh my god he's trying to
stick it in his butt.

1305
01:18:40,051 --> 01:18:41,028
Evelyn: NO!

1306
01:18:46,590 --> 01:18:47,297
Waymond: Uh, Evelyn!

1307
01:18:47,321 --> 01:18:48,223
Do jumping jacks!

1308
01:18:48,248 --> 01:18:49,536
Joy: That's not weird at all.

1309
01:18:49,816 --> 01:18:50,402
Waymond: Um

1310
01:18:50,512 --> 01:18:52,356
Joy: No, no no!
Slap him!

1311
01:18:52,910 --> 01:18:53,535
Joy: Mom, just

1312
01:18:53,872 --> 01:18:55,262
Blow on his nose!

1313
01:18:55,536 --> 01:18:56,192
Both: What?

1314
01:18:56,254 --> 01:18:57,188
It'll make him...

1315
01:18:57,212 --> 01:18:59,723
involuntarily scream
and do weird noises!

1316
01:18:59,748 --> 01:19:00,590
Waymond: Trust her, Evelyn!

1317
01:19:00,911 --> 01:19:01,911
It's really weird!

Alpha Gong-gong:
I'm sorry, Evelyn.

Alpha Gong-gong:
I'm sorry, Evelyn.

<i>Mind fracturing</i>

1328
01:21:10,348 --> 01:21:11,762

01:21:36,254 --> 01:21:36,567
Go!

1332
01:21:36,637 --> 01:21:37,286
I see her-

[smash noise]

1334
01:22:13,309 --> 01:22:13,950
Waymond: Evelyn!

1335
01:22:14,622 --> 01:22:15,270
Evelyn!

1336
01:22:15,872 --> 01:22:16,606
Evelyn!

1337
01:22:22,379 --> 01:22:23,848
No need to explain.

1338
01:22:26,465 --> 01:22:27,700
Alpha Waymond:
I have been watching you.

1339
01:22:29,067 --> 01:22:30,364
Evelyn: You're back!

1340
01:22:31,934 --> 01:22:33,301
Did you see how good I am?

1341
01:22:34,911 --> 01:22:35,684
I'm going to do it.

1342
01:22:36,583 --> 01:22:38,208
I am going to defeat that

1343
01:22:38,301 --> 01:22:39,825
Jobu Tupaki

1344
01:22:40,122 --> 01:22:40,458
Alpha Waymond:
Hey

1345
01:22:41,286 --> 01:22:42,208
You got her name right.

1346
01:22:44,512 --> 01:22:45,239
Evelyn

1347
01:22:46,098 --> 01:22:47,567
What you're doing is crazy!

1348
01:22:48,083 --> 01:22:49,153
Reckless

1349
01:22:49,872 --> 01:22:52,458
Your stupid plan to somehow
save your daughter

1350
01:22:52,483 --> 01:22:53,949
has managed to piss off

1351
01:22:53,974 --> 01:22:54,555
everyone

1352
01:22:54,579 --> 01:22:55,762
in the multiverse

1353
01:22:57,840 --> 01:22:59,262
And it just might work.

1354
01:23:03,496 --> 01:23:03,895
Evelyn: What?

1355
01:23:09,597 --> 01:23:10,387
[jobens the door]

1356
01:23:18,372 --> 01:23:19,660
Alpha Waymond:
I only wish I could be there

1357
01:23:19,685 --> 01:23:20,887
to see you finish this

1358
01:23:21,161 --> 01:23:22,786
Evelyn: What do you mean you
don't see me finish?

1359
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:25,083
Alpha Waymond:
I'm grateful

1360
01:23:25,254 --> 01:23:26,950
that chance was kind enough

1361
01:23:27,075 --> 01:23:29,770
to let us have these last
few moments together

1362
01:23:45,981 --> 01:23:46,778
Alpha Waymond?

1363
01:23:48,661 --> 01:23:49,473
Alpha Waymond?

1364
01:23:50,809 --> 01:23:51,614
Waymond: What happened?

1365
01:23:52,754 --> 01:23:54,372
Was I raccoon Waymond again?

1366
01:23:57,856 --> 01:23:59,504
Evelyn: Raccoon Waymond is dead.

1367
01:24:03,239 --> 01:24:04,551
Waymond: And that's-- Raccoon Joy?

1368
01:24:06,066 --> 01:24:07,090
Am I getting it?

1369
01:24:09,684 --> 01:24:11,379
Evelyn: I'm gonna stop you, Jobu.

1370
01:24:11,981 --> 01:24:14,629
Now that I'm reaching my full potential.

1371
01:24:14,997 --> 01:24:17,489
Jobu Tupaki:
No, you still can't see what's happening.

1372
01:24:17,661 --> 01:24:19,028
Evelyn: No, I see clearly.

1373
01:24:19,715 --> 01:24:22,169
More clearly than <i>ever before!</i>

1374
01:24:38,606 --> 01:24:40,215
Waymond: Oh my god! Evelyn!

1375
01:24:42,083 --> 01:24:42,708
Oh my god!

1376
01:24:45,247 --> 01:24:45,809
Jobu Tupaki:
Damnit.

1377
01:24:47,012 --> 01:24:47,668
So close.

1378
01:24:48,083 --> 01:24:48,629
Waymond: Evelyn!

1379
01:24:49,294 --> 01:24:49,762
Evelyn?

1380
01:24:51,192 --> 01:24:52,137
Please help her!

1381
01:24:53,715 --> 01:24:55,379
Jobu Tupaki:
I'll see you again soon.

1382

1387
01:25:42,859 --> 01:25:43,921
Evelyn: Where is she?

1388
01:25:45,038 --> 01:25:46,038
Where's our daughter?

1389
01:25:49,632 --> 01:25:50,398

Chad: You can't tell no one

1402
01:26:28,233 --> 01:26:29,538
Raccoccoonie: She's seen too much!

1403
01:26:29,976 --> 01:26:31,273
Raccoccoonie: You know what that means.

1404
01:26:31,413 --> 01:26:32,804
Get her. Get her!

1405
01:26:32,829 --> 01:26:34,054

1435
01:29:12,984 --> 01:29:14,227
Jobu Tupaki:
You see it all, don't you?

1436
01:29:19,993 --> 01:29:21,618
You can see...

1437
01:29:22,868 --> 01:29:24,657
...how <i>everything</i>...

1438
01:29:25,766 --> 01:29:29,274
...is just a random rearrangement
of particles in a...

1439

...vibrating superposition.

1440
01:29:38,149 --> 01:29:40,212
Evelyn: I have no idea what
you are talking about

1441
01:29:40,352 --> 01:29:41,547
but I can-

1442
01:29:44,501 --> 01:29:44,922
Huh?

1443
01:29:45,907 --> 01:29:47,110
Jobu Tupaki:
But you see

1444
01:29:47,782 --> 01:29:48,932
how everything

1445
01:29:49,268 --> 01:29:50,448
we feel

1446
01:29:53,722 --> 01:29:54,866
gets washed away

1447
01:29:54,890 --> 01:29:58,433
in a sea of every
other possibility

1448
01:30:02,534 --> 01:30:03,854
You're everywhere.

1449
01:30:06,605 --> 01:30:07,691
You're like me.

1450
01:30:08,433 --> 01:30:09,378
Evelyn: That's right.

1451
01:30:10,222 --> 01:30:11,816
I'm the one you're looking for.

1452
01:30:13,112 --> 01:30:15,042
I'm the one who's
going to defeat you!

1453
01:30:15,067 --> 01:30:16,340
Jobu Tupaki:
Hahaha, okay.

1454
01:30:19,198 --> 01:30:20,073
Hit me.

01:30:32,659 --> 01:30:33,417
Jobu: Oh!

1458
01:30:33,442 --> 01:30:34,130

1468
01:30:52,606 --> 01:30:54,059
Evelyn: I will take <i>care</i> of it!

1469
01:30:54,084 --> 01:30:54,520
Jobu: She'll take care of it, dad.
Evelyn: I will take <i>care</i> of it!

1470
01:30:54,545 --> 01:30:55,419
Jobu: She'll take care of it, dad.

1471
01:30:55,606 --> 01:30:56,005
Evelyn: Go!

1472
01:30:56,544 --> 01:30:57,669
Waymond: Honey, you okay?

1473
01:30:57,919 --> 01:30:59,614
Jobu: Yeah, I just fell
on the couch.

1474
01:30:59,794 --> 01:31:00,544
Evelyn: Go!

1475
01:31:01,403 --> 01:31:01,942
Waymond: Okay.

1476
01:31:06,848 --> 01:31:07,699
Jobu Tupaki:
So sweet.

1477
01:31:09,442 --> 01:31:09,981
[sighs]

1478
01:31:10,372 --> 01:31:10,825
Okay.

1479
01:31:11,559 --> 01:31:12,098
Jobu Tupaki: Hey!

1480
01:31:12,123 --> 01:31:12,231
Hey!

1481
01:31:12,256 --> 01:31:12,568
Evelyn: What, but
Hey!

1482
01:31:12,592 --> 01:31:13,043
Buddy!

1483
01:31:13,068 --> 01:31:13,504
Evelyn: If you don't want to fight me
Buddy!

1484
01:31:13,529 --> 01:31:14,692
Evelyn: If you don't want to fight me

1485
01:31:15,231 --> 01:31:16,528
Th- wh- th- th- then-

1486
01:31:17,637 --> 01:31:18,114
Why?

1487
01:31:18,411 --> 01:31:19,052
Jobu Tupaki:
Why wha?

1488
01:31:19,161 --> 01:31:20,575
Evelyn: Wh- wh- what's all this for?

1489
01:31:23,192 --> 01:31:24,559
Jobu Tupaki:
Why was I looking for you?

1490
01:31:25,802 --> 01:31:26,302
Evelyn: Yeah.

1491
01:31:31,145 --> 01:31:31,716
Jobu Tupaki:
Siddown.

1492
01:31:33,200 --> 01:31:33,801
Siddooown!

1493
01:31:33,826 --> 01:31:34,590
Grab a snack!

1494
01:31:34,615 --> 01:31:35,794
Make yourself comfortable!

1495
01:31:36,216 --> 01:31:36,739
Yeah?

1496
01:31:36,887 --> 01:31:37,223
Oh

1497
01:31:37,387 --> 01:31:37,762
Hey

1498
01:31:37,787 --> 01:31:37,934
You okay?

1499
01:31:37,959 --> 01:31:38,590
Evelyn: Okay
You okay?

1500
01:31:40,825 --> 01:31:41,255
Jobu Tupaki:
Mmph

1501
01:31:42,192 --> 01:31:43,567
We can speed this up.

1502
01:31:44,403 --> 01:31:45,450
Sit on the crack.

1503
01:31:47,152 --> 01:31:48,348
Sit on the crack of the couch.

1504
01:31:48,457 --> 01:31:49,028
Okay?

1505
01:31:49,216 --> 01:31:50,114
Get comfortable

1506
01:31:56,780 --> 01:31:57,866
[smiles in bagel]

1507
01:32:02,070 --> 01:32:03,139
Evelyn: Bagel...

1508
01:32:07,429 --> 01:32:08,144
Please!

1509
01:32:08,168 --> 01:32:09,460
I don't care about the bagel

1510
01:32:09,485 --> 01:32:11,085
I don't care about the Alpha Verse!

1511
01:32:11,218 --> 01:32:12,976
I only care about my Joy!

1512
01:32:13,062 --> 01:32:15,898
Give me back my daughter and
I'll leave you alone forever!

1513
01:32:15,999 --> 01:32:16,765
Jobu Tupaki:
Sorry!

1514
01:32:16,790 --> 01:32:17,890
No can do.

1515
01:32:18,492 --> 01:32:19,413
Evelyn: (whispers) Why not?!

1516
01:32:19,734 --> 01:32:20,945
Jobu Tupaki:
I am your daughter.

1517
01:32:21,242 --> 01:32:22,601
Your daughter is me.

1518
01:32:22,695 --> 01:32:24,999
Every version of Joy

1519
01:32:25,085 --> 01:32:25,882
<i>is</i>

1520
01:32:26,015 --> 01:32:27,132
Jobu Tupaki

1521
01:32:27,367 --> 01:32:28,882
You can't separate us.

1522
01:32:29,186 --> 01:32:29,952
Evelyn: N-no

1523
01:32:30,749 --> 01:32:31,976
Jobu Tupaki:
I have felt

1524
01:32:32,132 --> 01:32:33,796
everything your daughter has felt

1525
01:32:38,265 --> 01:32:39,445
and I know...

1526
01:32:40,312 --> 01:32:41,538
the joy

1527
01:32:43,273 --> 01:32:45,687
and the pain of having <i>you</i>
as my mother

1528
01:32:48,023 --> 01:32:49,117
Evelyn: Then you know

1529
01:32:49,843 --> 01:32:50,546
I would do--

1530
01:32:50,571 --> 01:32:52,609
<i>only</i> do the right thing for her

1531
01:32:53,890 --> 01:32:54,757
For <i>you</i>

1532
01:32:55,843 --> 01:32:57,222
Jobu Tupaki:
Right is a tiny box

1533
01:32:57,246 --> 01:32:59,617
invented by people
who are afraid

1534
01:33:00,062 --> 01:33:01,206
And I know what it feels like

1535
01:33:01,230 --> 01:33:03,312
to be trapped inside that box.

1536
01:33:06,671 --> 01:33:07,515
Joy: Mom...

1537
01:33:08,609 --> 01:33:10,093
Evelyn: No, it's not like that...

1538
01:33:10,288 --> 01:33:11,366
It's Gong-gong

1539
01:33:11,570 --> 01:33:12,906
He's a <i>different generation!</i>

1540
01:33:12,931 --> 01:33:15,350
Jobu Tupaki:
No, you don't have to
hide behind him anymore.

1541
01:33:15,585 --> 01:33:16,867
You should feel relieved

1542
01:33:17,257 --> 01:33:18,234
The Bagel

1543
01:33:18,562 --> 01:33:20,531
will show you the
true nature of things

1544
01:33:21,148 --> 01:33:22,867
You'll be free from that box

1545
01:33:23,202 --> 01:33:24,194
just like me.

1546
01:33:24,234 --> 01:33:24,730
Evelyn: No!

1547
01:33:24,754 --> 01:33:25,241
No.

1548
01:33:25,266 --> 01:33:26,230
I'm not like you.

1549
01:33:26,254 --> 01:33:27,265
You- you- you're young.

1550
01:33:27,320 --> 01:33:29,116
And life is always changing

1551
01:33:29,765 --> 01:33:31,937
I still know who I am.

1552
01:33:32,077 --> 01:33:33,984
Jobu Tupaki:
You have no idea what you've done.

1553
01:33:34,726 --> 01:33:36,421
You're stuck like this forever.

1554
01:33:38,601 --> 01:33:39,156
Evelyn: No

1555
01:33:39,570 --> 01:33:41,249
I'm going back with <i>my</i> Joy

1556
01:33:41,358 --> 01:33:42,312
to <i>my</i> family

1557
01:33:42,695 --> 01:33:44,093
to live <i>my</i> life

1558
01:33:44,687 --> 01:33:46,054
a <i>happy</i> life!

1559
01:33:46,890 --> 01:33:47,601
Jobu Tupaki:
Okay.

1560
01:33:50,093 --> 01:33:51,437
<i>Good luck with that.</i>

1561
01:34:05,140 --> 01:34:06,366
Waymond: Thank you so much
for coming!

1562
01:34:11,695 --> 01:34:13,023
Thank you, thank you!
Bye bye!

1563
01:34:27,452 --> 01:34:28,734
Jobu Tupaki:
All this time

1564
01:34:31,023 --> 01:34:33,835
I wasn't looking for you
so I could <i>kill</i> you

1565
01:34:37,015 --> 01:34:39,034
I was just looking for
someone who could

1566
01:34:39,058 --> 01:34:40,531
see what I see

1567
01:34:43,468 --> 01:34:44,273
feel

1568
01:34:44,531 --> 01:34:45,851
what I feel

1569
01:35:08,859 --> 01:35:10,343
Jobu Tupaki:
And that someone

1570
01:35:15,492 --> 01:35:16,867
Is you.

1571
01:35:18,624 --> 01:35:19,312
Waymond: Evelyn!

1572
01:35:20,843 --> 01:35:21,820
You're alive!

1573
01:35:22,046 --> 01:35:23,132
Alpha Gong-gong:
Impossible!

1574
01:35:27,733 --> 01:35:28,397
Evelyn: Hello?

1575
01:35:28,422 --> 01:35:29,218
Dierdre: Mrs. Wang?

1576
01:35:29,327 --> 01:35:29,906
Where-

1577
01:35:29,931 --> 01:35:30,523
Where <i>are</i> you?

1578
01:35:30,781 --> 01:35:33,148
I mean, to not even <i>show up?</i>

1579
01:35:33,343 --> 01:35:34,437
For your appointment?

1580
01:35:34,462 --> 01:35:35,320
Evelyn: Shut up.

1581
01:35:35,624 --> 01:35:36,898
Dierdre: What did you just say?

1582
01:35:37,710 --> 01:35:38,687
Evelyn: I said shut up.

1583
01:35:39,124 --> 01:35:40,093
You don't matter

1584
01:35:40,554 --> 01:35:42,202
Hot-dog Diedre:
Whatever I did, I'm sorry...

1585
01:35:42,577 --> 01:35:43,781
Evelyn: Nothing matters.

1586
01:35:44,015 --> 01:35:45,499
Dierdre:
<i>Mrs. Wang!</i>

1587
01:35:45,843 --> 01:35:47,671
You are going to be in serious trouble!

1588
01:35:47,696 --> 01:35:48,577
[bagel distortions]
You are going to be in serious trouble!

1589
01:35:48,601 --> 01:35:48,952
[bagel distortions]

1590
01:35:48,976 --> 01:35:50,523
[bagel distortions]
Do you understand?

1591
01:35:50,585 --> 01:35:51,811
Now you can disrespect--

1592
01:35:51,836 --> 01:35:52,257
[beep]

1593
01:36:19,359 --> 01:36:21,327
Evelyn: Happy new year!

1594
01:36:22,663 --> 01:36:24,281
Another year, hmm?

1595
01:36:24,796 --> 01:36:27,695
Pretending we know what
we're doing, but really?

1596
01:36:28,242 --> 01:36:30,929
We're just going around
in circles

1597
01:36:31,976 --> 01:36:33,296
Doing laundry

1598
01:36:33,406 --> 01:36:34,077
taxes

1599
01:36:34,179 --> 01:36:35,249
and laundry

1600
01:36:35,296 --> 01:36:35,984
and taxes

1601
01:36:44,327 --> 01:36:45,249
No more running.

1602
01:36:45,274 --> 01:36:46,804
Dierdre: Excuse me,
where are the owners?

1603
01:36:47,070 --> 01:36:47,859
Oh!

1604
01:36:49,062 --> 01:36:49,558
There you are

1605
01:36:49,582 --> 01:36:50,999
Mr. and Mrs. Wang

1606
01:36:52,163 --> 01:36:54,226
You have left me no option

1607
01:36:54,251 --> 01:36:55,406
but to authorise

1608
01:36:55,507 --> 01:36:57,284
the seizure of your personal

1609
01:36:57,308 --> 01:36:58,820
and your business assets

1610
01:36:59,195 --> 01:37:00,812
You have to vacate the premises

1611
01:37:09,968 --> 01:37:10,413
Chad: What are you doing-

1612
01:37:10,438 --> 01:37:11,054
No! <i>No!</i>

1613
01:37:11,827 --> 01:37:12,464
What the--

1614
01:37:12,489 --> 01:37:14,023
Raccoccoonie: Chad I told you she
couldn't be trusted!

1615
01:37:14,210 --> 01:37:14,867
Waymond: Evelyn!

1616
01:37:14,892 --> 01:37:15,492
Please!

1617
01:37:15,663 --> 01:37:16,726
Calm down!

1618
01:37:17,679 --> 01:37:19,436
Dierdre: Within 48 hours, or--

1619
01:37:27,796 --> 01:37:29,976
Evelyn: Ev...ry...thing...

1620
01:37:39,898 --> 01:37:40,968
Waymond: What are you doing?

1621
01:37:48,129 --> 01:37:50,165
Not a single moment will go by

1622
01:37:50,190 --> 01:37:51,896
without every other universe

1623
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:53,876
screaming for your attention

1624
01:37:56,968 --> 01:37:58,656
Never fully there...

1625
01:37:59,328 --> 01:38:01,249
just a lifetime of...

1626
01:38:01,953 --> 01:38:02,968
Chad: No, master, no!

1627
01:38:03,054 --> 01:38:04,218
Jobu: Fractured moments...

1628
01:38:04,243 --> 01:38:05,359
Chad: <i>Raccoccoonie!!</i>
Jobu: Fractured moments...

1629
01:38:06,117 --> 01:38:08,570
Contradictions and confusion...

1630
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:09,257
Chad: Get off me!

1631
01:38:09,282 --> 01:38:11,078
Raccoccoonie: Chad, don't forget about me
Chef: Get off me!

1632
01:38:11,103 --> 01:38:12,273
Diedre: Here are the papers.

1633
01:38:13,328 --> 01:38:13,914
Oh!

1634
01:38:14,211 --> 01:38:15,984
Who-o-oa! Officer!

1635
01:38:24,172 --> 01:38:25,851
Jobu Tupaki:
With only a few specks of time

1636
01:38:25,876 --> 01:38:28,999
where anything actually makes any sense

1637
01:38:31,562 --> 01:38:34,875
Evelyn: I've always hated this place...

1638
01:38:36,976 --> 01:38:37,703
Waymond: Evelyn!

1639
01:38:42,093 --> 01:38:42,819
Chad: <i>Raccoccoonie!</i>

1640
01:38:42,844 --> 01:38:44,390
Raccoccoonie: Chaaaad!

1641
01:42:11,898 --> 01:42:14,250
Jobu Tupaki:
You know why I actually built the bagel?

1642
01:42:15,750 --> 01:42:18,476
It wasn't do "destroy everything"...

1643
01:42:19,687 --> 01:42:21,820
It was to destroy myself.

1644
01:42:23,554 --> 01:42:24,960
I wanted to see if I went in

1645
01:42:24,985 --> 01:42:27,000
could I <i>finally</i> escape

1646
01:42:29,523 --> 01:42:31,242
Like, actually die?

1647
01:42:34,461 --> 01:42:35,883

02:03:54,788 --> 02:03:55,913
STOP!

1833
02:03:59,108 --> 02:03:59,764
<i>Mom!</i>

1834
02:04:00,436 --> 02:04:01,264
just-

1835
02:04:01,546 --> 02:04:02,530
Just <i>stop!</i>

1836
02:04:03,967 --> 02:04:04,729
Well good for you

1837
02:04:04,753 --> 02:04:06,014
you're figuring your shit out

1838
02:04:08,108 --> 02:04:08,874
That's

1839
02:04:08,899 --> 02:04:09,796
great. I'm really

1840
02:04:09,905 --> 02:04:10,608
<i>really</i>

1841
02:04:10,678 --> 02:04:11,819
happy for you.

1842
02:04:13,663 --> 02:04:14,694
But I-

1843
02:04:16,764 --> 02:04:18,327
I'm <i>tired</i>

1844
02:04:20,913 --> 02:04:22,448
I don't wanna hurt anymore and

1845
02:04:22,472 --> 02:04:24,874
for some reason when
I'm with you it just-

1846
02:04:27,217 --> 02:04:29,108
it just hurts the both of us.

1847
02:04:33,272 --> 02:04:35,975
So let's just go our separate ways, okay?

1848
02:04:38,077 --> 02:04:38,999
Just let me

1849
02:04:39,288 --> 02:04:39,866
<i>go</i>

1850
02:04:52,905 --> 02:04:53,514
Evelyn: Okay.

1851
02:05:29,811 --> 02:05:30,569
Wait.

1852
02:05:38,506 --> 02:05:39,624
You <i>are</i> getting fat.

1853
02:05:40,108 --> 02:05:42,889
And you never call me
even though we have family plan.

1854
02:05:42,921 --> 02:05:43,288
Joy: What.

1855
02:05:43,313 --> 02:05:44,280
Evelyn: And it's free!

1856
02:05:44,491 --> 02:05:45,510
You only visit

1857
02:05:45,534 --> 02:05:46,702
when <i>you</i> need something!

1858
02:05:46,928 --> 02:05:47,999
And you got a tattoo!

1859
02:05:48,024 --> 02:05:49,100
And I don't care

1860
02:05:49,358 --> 02:05:51,022
if it's supposed to
represent our family

1861
02:05:51,085 --> 02:05:52,897
you <i>know</i> I hate tattoos

1862
02:05:53,194 --> 02:05:53,624
And-

1863
02:05:53,694 --> 02:05:55,538
of all the places I could be?

1864
02:05:56,163 --> 02:05:57,671
Why would I want
to be here with you?

1865
02:05:58,452 --> 02:05:59,053
Yes.

1866
02:05:59,538 --> 02:06:00,069
You're right.

1867
02:06:00,725 --> 02:06:02,163
It doesn't make sense!

1868
02:06:02,335 --> 02:06:02,999
Waymond: Evelyn

1869
02:06:04,983 --> 02:06:06,131
Joy: Let her finish!

1870
02:06:09,131 --> 02:06:10,514
Evelyn: Maybe it's like you said

1871
02:06:11,772 --> 02:06:13,983
Maybe there is something out there

1872
02:06:14,381 --> 02:06:16,022
Some new discovery

1873
02:06:16,499 --> 02:06:17,713
that will make us feel

1874
02:06:17,737 --> 02:06:20,296
like even smaller pieces of shit

1875
02:06:21,983 --> 02:06:23,952
Something that explains why

1876
02:06:24,952 --> 02:06:26,499
you still went looking for me

1877
02:06:27,264 --> 02:06:28,819
through all of this noise

1878
02:06:31,881 --> 02:06:32,639
and why

1879
02:06:33,546 --> 02:06:34,655
no matter what

1880
02:06:35,561 --> 02:06:37,694
I still want to be here with you

1881
02:06:39,960 --> 02:06:41,702
I will <i>always</i>

1882
02:06:43,569 --> 02:06:44,733
<i>Always</i>

1883
02:06:45,944 --> 02:06:48,163
want to be here with you.

1884
02:06:51,178 --> 02:06:52,467
Joy: So what?

1885
02:06:56,327 --> 02:06:58,811
Are you just gonna
ignore everything else?

1886
02:07:00,256 --> 02:07:02,717
You could be <i>anything, anywhere</i>

1887
02:07:07,397 --> 02:07:09,780
Why not go somewhere where your

1888
02:07:13,264 --> 02:07:15,546
where your daughter is more than just

1889
02:07:17,452 --> 02:07:18,342
<i>this?</i>

1890
02:07:20,913 --> 02:07:22,374
Here, all we get

1891
02:07:22,999 --> 02:07:24,381
are a few

1892
02:07:25,303 --> 02:07:29,686
specks of time where
any of this actually makes any sense

1893
02:07:35,663 --> 02:07:37,116
Evelyn: Then I will cherish

1894
02:07:38,342 --> 02:07:40,288
these few specks of time

1895
02:07:48,475 --> 02:07:50,046
Dierdre: Push the button

1896
02:07:50,796 --> 02:07:51,264
There

1897
02:07:51,460 --> 02:07:52,421
Down you go

1898
02:07:52,694 --> 02:07:53,788
I feel like I'm fourteen...

1899
02:07:55,865 --> 02:07:56,561
[laughs] Yeah

1900
02:08:02,178 --> 02:08:03,654
Chad: I'm sorry, Raccoccoonie

1901
02:08:03,772 --> 02:08:04,522
I'm sor...

1902
02:08:05,592 --> 02:08:06,319
What are you doing?

1903
02:08:06,397 --> 02:08:07,631
Evelyn: Grab my hair!

1904
02:08:21,888 --> 02:08:23,350
Becky: What did he say?

1905
02:09:36,811 --> 02:09:38,374
Joy: So awkward...

1906
02:09:41,202 --> 02:09:42,444
It's awkward, right?

1907
02:09:47,405 --> 02:09:49,530
...Do you still wanna do your party?

1908
02:09:50,975 --> 02:09:53,381
Evelyn: We could do whatever we want.

1909
02:09:57,889 --> 02:09:59,006
Nothing matters.

1910
02:10:12,944 --> 02:10:15,702
Joy: Okay, we're definitely late now, guys.

1911
02:10:18,014 --> 02:10:19,522
Do you have to bring <i>all</i> of these?

1912
02:10:19,719 --> 02:10:20,194
Evelyn: Mmhm

1913
02:10:20,975 --> 02:10:22,553
That needs to go in the back, too.

1914
02:10:24,233 --> 02:10:25,592
Joy: Taxes suck.

1915
02:10:34,991 --> 02:10:36,631
Waymond: Thank you
for the ride, Becky!

1916
02:10:37,975 --> 02:10:38,467
Joy: Hey

1917
02:10:39,374 --> 02:10:39,975
Things okay?

1918
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:40,990
Becky: Mmhm. You got this, okay?

1919
02:10:41,015 --> 02:10:41,639
Evelyn: Becky?
Becky: Mmhm. You got this, okay?

1920
02:10:41,664 --> 02:10:42,413
Evelyn: Becky?
Joy: I'll call you after

1921
02:10:42,764 --> 02:10:43,983
Evelyn: You need to
grow your hair

1922
02:10:53,280 --> 02:10:54,194
Joy: I'll call you later!

1923
02:11:01,397 --> 02:11:02,124
I gotta pee.

1924
02:11:02,483 --> 02:11:02,960
Hold on.

1925
02:11:02,985 --> 02:11:03,616
Evelyn: Okay

1926
02:11:41,131 --> 02:11:41,944
Diedre: Okay.

1927
02:11:42,491 --> 02:11:42,983
Yes.

1928
02:11:43,671 --> 02:11:45,280
I am happy to say

1929
02:11:45,413 --> 02:11:46,749
I do think...

1930
02:11:47,163 --> 02:11:47,893
Things are better.

1931
02:11:47,917 --> 02:11:48,577
This is

1932
02:11:48,602 --> 02:11:50,421
This is, uh, an improvement

1933
02:11:50,616 --> 02:11:51,436
And I'm-

1934
02:11:51,461 --> 02:11:52,741
I'm glad that you listened.

1935
02:11:52,766 --> 02:11:53,850
But! We have a problem

1936
02:11:54,287 --> 02:11:56,514
Because you listened,
but you didn't listen

1937
02:11:56,803 --> 02:11:58,921
And that has to do with the
Schedule Cs

1938
02:11:58,946 --> 02:11:59,546
You see--

1939
02:12:12,111 --> 02:12:12,837
Evelyn!

1940
02:12:12,862 --> 02:12:13,822
Did you hear me?

1941
02:12:14,244 --> 02:12:14,775
Evelyn: Sorry

1942
02:12:16,010 --> 02:12:16,947
What did you say?

1943
02:12:35,177 --> 02:12:39,412
