					<div class="cityTitle">The Council of Nodd</div>
					
					<div class="citytext">The Council of Nodd is accepted by most to have been present as long as the city itself, and its origins are likewise unknown. This doesn’t stop citizens from having their own theories, which range from scientific theories to utter madness - some individuals regard the entity as a higher power capable of far more than just maintaining order. The secretive and often destructive nature of the Council does little in keeping these conspiracies at bay. </div>
					
					<div class="citytext">The Council of Nodd is made up of the major and minor council.</div>
					
					<div class="cityTitle">The Major Council</div>
					
					<div class="citytext">The major council is made up of the citygods and The Unseen Ones - a small group of anonymous figures who deal directly with the citygods. These unknown entities convey the collective will of the citygods to the minor council for enforcement.</div>
					
					<div class="citytext">Each citygod is an ancient and corrupted cityspeaker, considered the most powerful in their aspect of magic. Each also has a following - called a house - as a source of belief to sustain power.</div>
					
					<div class="citytext">Citygods receive treatment that falls between royalty and imprisonment. Generally restricted to their chambers but housed lavishly, their purpose is to assess the needs of the city, and to answer inquiries posed by the minor council.</div>

					<div class="cityTitle">The Minor Council</div>
					
					<div class="citytext">The minor council attempts to enact and enforce the will of the collective major council through rapidly-changing laws, announcements, and regulations.</div>
					
					<div class="citytext">The Minor Council also gives formal judgment on disputes between citizens or corporations. A court hearing may be requested by anyone, but most are ignored. In some cases, a citizen may even face punishment for requesting a court hearing over something deemed particularly petty or suspected of being anti-Council.</div>
					
					<div class="citytext">​The minor council and its attendants also oversee any Council-directed processes and establishments.</div>
					
					<div class="cityTitle">The Council Spire</div>
					
					<div class="citytext">​​The Council Spire is a large tower in the center of Nodd. It serves as the headquarters for the Council, as well as the residence of all members of the major council. Their respective houses connect to their quarters via heavily-guarded skybridges.</div>
					
					<div class="cityTitle">Council Attendants</div>
					
					<div class="citytext">​​Council attendants are given a variety of roles.</div>
				</div>
				
				<div id="The Courts" class="tab" style="display:none">
					<div class="cityTitle">The Courts</div>
					
					<div class="cityText">The minor council is made up of various organizations known as Courts.</div>
					
					<div class="cityText">The courts are sections of the Council Spire, and usually refer to the buildings through which citizens can access related services.</div>
					
					<div class="cityText">​<b>Court of Analysis</b> - Responsible for exploring and documenting the world and its magic.</div>
					
					<div class="cityText"><b>Court of Architecture</b> - Responsible for anything related to buildings, including housing. Organizes and enacts The Pruning.</div>
					
					<div class="cityText"><b>Court of Ceremony</b> - Responsible for any Council-organized events and ceremonies.</div>
					
					<div class="cityText"><b>Court of Discipline</b> - Deals with anything relating to The Underchambers, public punishment, and execution. All Council Pawns and Knights belong to the Court of Discipline.</div>
					
					<div class="cityText"><b>Court of Induction</b> - Ushers outsiders into the city and provides them with a brief invasive probing, both physical and mental, as well as an orientation seminar explaining the workings of Nodd. Often, a mage from the Court of Analysis will be on site, standing by to document new outsider species.</div>
					
					<div class="cityText"><b>Court of Information</b> - Responsible for all the Council’s bookkeeping. Contains information on all citizens, organizations, magic use, and almost everything else.</div>
					
					<div class="cityText"><b>Court of Medicine</b> - The Council's hospital.</div>
					
					<div class="cityText"><b>Court of Resurrection</b> - Responsible for reviving citizens. Also determines how many death allowances a citizen gets, based on information provided by the Court of Information.</div>
					
					<div class="cityText"><b>Court of Sanitation</b> - Responsible for keeping the city streets free of corpses and garbage - at least enough to allow passage.</div>

					<div class="cityTitle">Citizens of Nodd</div>
					
					<div class="cityText">Nodd is a city of monsters, and is fantastically diverse. An endless variety of exotic, dangerous, beautiful, and mundane creatures liven its streets; if you’re an outsider, encountering another of your own kind may be a rarity. Oftentimes a single individual of a species will find its way to Nodd and blend into the madness with no effort.</div>
					
					<div class="cityTitle">Insiders & Outsiders</div>
					
					<div class="cityText">Citizens of Nodd are either insiders or outsiders. An insider refers to any organism that originated in the realm of Nodd. They are said to be born of Nodd's unspoken needs, influenced by unknown arcane mechanics. </div>
					
					<div class="cityText">Insiders can take on any number of appearances, and some are unlike any others. However, there are several that are considered common enough in Nodd that they're identified with names, such as slyne and ravel. Cross-species hybrids are common and referred to simply as hybrids, or some awkward informal hybrid-name (such as a slyvel, in the case of a ravel and slyne mix). Even more common are ambiguous mutt species, which are referred to as “chimerae”. </div>
					
					<div class="cityText">Outsiders, on the other hand, inexplicably appear before the city's gates, seemingly cast onto its doorstep from another mundane reality. These special creatures are a recent anomaly, and are rather rare, sparking curiosity among insiders. The Council has even taken to calling them the Chosen Ones, and has established a protocol for ushering new outsiders into the city. Alongside most inhabitants of Nodd, these creatures often appear beautiful, if not divine. Insiders regard them in a wide variety of ways, from intrigue to abject hostility.</div>
					
					<div class="cityText">Outsiders who end up in Nodd don't seem to remember the series of events directly before they wake up before the gates to the city, but rather snippets of their past life that return to them in dreams and visions.</div>
					
					<div class="cityTitle">Micros & Macros</div>
					
					<div class="cityText">Nodd's variety of inhabitants means a variety of sizes are involved.</div>
					
					<div class="cityText">Microcitizens - usually referred to as "micros" - are those deemed too small to use most of the city's amenities. Macrocitizens - macros - are the opposite. For micros, this begins somewhere around one foot in height; for macros, anything much beyond fifteen feet begins to be problematic. </div>
					
					<div class="cityText">Due to a punishment administered by the Council - a practice simply referred to as "Shrinking" - convicted citizens may find themselves released into the city a mere four inches in height. Many citizens are micro for this reason.</div>
					
					<div class="cityText">Microcitizens may have a challenging time surviving in Nodd, and are subject to various forms of abuse and objectification, such as culinary use (in which case they're referred to as "tenderlings") and research fodder. Often, a micro will try to establish a relationship with someone trustworthy of average size, and seek shelter, protection, and sustenance from them. Some average citizens repurpose closets, wardrobes, or spare rooms as micro apartments or townships. The specific locations of these tends to be kept between micros and their keepers, lest someone be tempted to sell a large quantity of healthy micros for some unsavory purpose.</div>
					
					<div class="cityText">Macrocitizens are less at risk for mistreatment, and may themselves be a source of fear for average-sized citizens. Destructive or feared macros are known colloquially as "kaiju", and their destruction is often not contained or discouraged by the Council, unless of course it gets out of hand. Most macros can be easily contained by powerful spells, and strive to keep just within the Council's tolerance.</div>
					
					<div class="cityText">Depending on size, there may not be many accommodations for macrocitizens that are not custom-built.</div>
				</div>
				
				<div id="Roles" class="tab" style="display:none">
					<div class="cityTitle">Roles</div>
					
					<div class="cityText">Here is a list of commonly encountered occupations and roles in Nodd. Naturally, a citizen may have one or many roles.</div>
					
					<div class="cityText">These differ from mage titles, which are gained in relation to a mage's reputation or position.</div>
					
					<div class="cityText"><b>Apothecarist</b> - Apothecarists create potions, drugs, and other substances. They’re often seen in the company of botanists.</div>
					
					<div class="cityText"><b>Architect</b> - Architects cultivate and maintain the buildings and other structures of Nodd. They grow and reshape them, as well as treat illnesses and perform surgeries.</div>
					
					<div class="cityText"><b>Arcanologist</b> - Arcanologists study the workings of Nodd, which may include magic itself, sapients, fauna, or flora.</div>
					
					<div class="cityText"><b>Assassin</b> - Assassins dispatch a chosen target in exchange for payment or services.</div>
					
					<div class="cityText"><b>Battlemage / Beastmage</b> - Battlemages engage in combat with other mages. These battles can often be seen in the streets of Nodd, where the attention of spectators can contribute to chaos generation. Some battlemages use beasts, which they may choose to fight alongside, or simply direct. Battlemages whose tactic relies primarily on beasts may call themselves "beastmages".</div>
					
					<div class="cityText">Like heroes and villains, battlemages may have their own alias and coordinated attire.</div>
					
					<div class="cityText"><b>Bartender</b> - Bartenders in Nodd are no different than those of other realms, serving drinks and gossip to those who patronize their establishment. Bars in Nodd tend to be very thematic, and often the employees will follow the given theme.</div>
					
					<div class="cityText"><b>Botanist</b> - Botanists cultivate and sell plants for various purposes. They often work in concert with apothecarists.</div>
					
					<div class="cityText"><b>Carriage Driver</b> - Carriage drivers employ beasts - usually miggwitches - to taxi citizens around the city.</div>
					
					<div class="cityText"><b>Chef</b> - The city boasts an exotic variety of items just waiting to be fried, baked, broiled, and sauteed. Nodd's chefs see to all this in order to please the discerning palates and satisfy the monstrous bellies of hungry citizens.</div>
					
					<div class="cityText"><b>Chirurgeon</b> - Chirurgeons use a variety of spells and instruments to treat wounds, illnesses, curses, parasites, and other afflictions.</div>
					
					<div class="cityText"><b>Cityspeaker</b> - A seer in Nodd. These individuals have a gift that allows them to sense the will of the City.</div>
					
					<div class="cityText"><b>Council Attendant</b> - Council Attendants work for the Council in various roles. See the Council page for more info.</div>
					
					<div class="cityText"><b>Drifter</b> - A drifter has no defined role, but wanders where they please and makes the most of their circumstances.</div>
					
					<div class="cityText"><b>Escort</b> - Escorts provide sexual services, and may employ magic, bizarre fetishes, unique experiences, or other special tactics to compete with others.</div>
					
					<div class="cityText"><b>Gondolier</b> - Gondoliers usher citizens through Nodd's canals on narrow boats, and may provide refreshments or entertainment for the journey.</div>
					
					<div class="cityText"><b>Hero</b> - Heroes take it upon themselves to protect the defenseless in Nodd, without demanding payment. Heros define themselves with an alias and coordinated attire.</div>
					
					<div class="cityText"><b>Hunter</b> - A hunter dispatches dangerous wildlife and other pests. Most hunters fill their home with exotic trophies from their kills.</div>
					
					<div class="cityText"><b>Menagerist</b> - These individuals make their living by collecting Nodd’s fauna and showing it off in a personal menagerie.</div>
					
					<div class="cityText"><b>Mercenary</b> - In Nodd, mercenaries offer protective services in exchange for payment.</div>
					
					<div class="cityText"><b>Pilot</b> - Pilots operate various aerial vehicles - often dirigibles and balloons - to ferry citizens through the city's skies.</div>
					
					<div class="cityText"><b>Stimulist</b> - These individuals offer torture services to those unable to generate enough chaos by other means. Their often small shops are recognizable by the large window in front of the torture chair; this allows passers-by to witness the horrors within. Often a crowd will gather for the duration, given the torturer is sufficiently skilled and creative - the bigger the audience, the more chaos is generated.</div>
					
					<div class="cityText">A session of torture pays both the torturer and torturee, but the establishment will often charge an additional cost for their services. </div>
					
					<div class="cityText"><b>Tempest</b> - Offers weather spell services, for your home or event.</div>
					
					<div class="cityText"><b>Tinker</b> - Creates, customizes, or restores artifacts.</div>
					
					<div class="cityText"><b>Villain</b> - Villains make it their job to impede heroes, or generally cause trouble to draw attention. Villains define themselves with an alias and coordinated attire.</div>
					
					<div class="cityText"><b>Vulture</b> - Vultures are those who scavenge the corpses of citizens for belongings or body parts. They will usually then go on to sell these items.</div>

					<div class="cityText">When used alone, this term usually refers to the flesh from the Abbatoir, which is usually a ground mix of sapient citizens, beasts, ambulant furniture, and whatever else gets scraped off the streets. Usually cheap and easy to come by.</div>
					
					<div class="cityText">The bodies are ground without much preparation, and quality control is minimal. It's not uncommon to find bones, teeth, claws, scales, fur, bits of clothing or jewelry in one's meat, so it's best to give it a brief inspection prior to cooking or eating.</div>
					
					<div class="cityTitle">Nectar</div>

					<div class="cityTitle">Shriek Bladder</div>

					<div class="cityTitle">Sloach</div>
					
					<div class="cityText">Sloach refers to an edible slug which is usually seasoned, skewered, and grilled. Boiling them is usually a terrible idea, as it causes them to become excessively slimy.</div>
					
					<div class="cityTitle">Tenderling</div>
					
					<div class="cityText">Tenderling is a term that refers to any microcitizen that has been deemed food. Calling one’s food a micro is considered a taboo by some. Tenderlings are good fried, boiled, baked, sauteed, juiced, candied, pickled, ground into sausage, or even eaten raw and alive.</div>

					<div class="cityText">Bug shots refer to the usage of glutlings as an alcohol delivery method. The tick-like worms will gorge themselves on any fluid they come in contact with - in this case, booze. Once swollen, they can be popped into the mouth and burst. The heads should then be spit out, as they continue to live and bite for several minutes.</div>
					
					<div class="cityTitle">Devilmint</div>
					
					<div class="cityText">Devilmint is a reddish, spade-shaped herb that, when consumed, inspires feelings of mischief. Pranks and vandalism often follow consumption.</div>

					<div class="cityTitle">Phantasm</div>

					<div class="cityTitle">Prickledust</div>
					
					<div class="cityText">Prickledust is a fine dust that causes a maddening itching sensation that does not abate with scratching. </div>
					
					<div class="cityTitle">Sparkle</div>
					
					<div class="cityText">Sparkle is a psychoactive magic substance. It makes the user feel loving, tolerant, and euphoric. It also temporarily alters their colors and markings to be more saturated and garish, which increases with dose.</div>
					
					<div class="cityTitle">Sweetsand</div>
					
					<div class="cityText">Sweetsand is a psychoactive magic substance that increases the user's ability to perceive high concentrations of sensory complexity. Best for solo use, as it tends to cause irritability in social situations. </div>

					<div class="cityText">Most punishmable crimes a citizen can commit are due to not generating enough chaos, or going against the Council in some way. Punishments and executions are performed day and night in The Amphitheater, and the public is encouraged to attend. A citizen can access a schedule of upcoming punishments and executions via their ego bracer, and attend whatever piques their interest.</div>
					
					<div class="cityText">Any spells used by a Council Reaper are likely to be of the highest caliber.</div>
					
					<div class="cityTitle">Beast Chaining</div>
					
					<div class="cityText">During beast-chaining, the victim is restrictively bound to a large, usually quadrupedal beast in some degrading or undesirable way. Often, the victim will have their mouth, genitals, or anus affixed to the creature’s anus or sheath.</div>

					<div class="cityTitle">The Funnel</div>

					<div class="cityText">Guillotines in Nodd have more than a single hole for the neck. Generally speaking, a victim is forced to place their limbs, tail, and genitalia into separate holes, which may be long to allow for several blades to cleave appendages into several pieces.</div>
					
					<div class="cityTitle">Inanimate Confinement</div>
					
					<div class="cityText">A victim subjected to inanimate confinement is forcibly transformed into an object for a designated period of time. The object is usually something degrading or unpleasant, and something that will then be used by citizens. Examples may include garbage cans, urinals, toilets, rugs, or similar items.</div>
					
					<div class="cityTitle">Mortification</div>
					
					<div class="cityText">During mortification, the victim is subjected to the spell Mortify, which causes something embarrassing to happen to the target. This is done in a highly public area.</div>
					
					<div class="cityTitle">The Pillory</div>
					
					<div class="cityText">The pillory refers to a wooden device for restraining the neck, wrists, and genitals. Often citizens will be encouraged to harass the victim in any way desirable.</div>
					
					<div class="cityTitle">Prickling</div>
					
					<div class="cityText">Prickling is a torture that involves the victim stripped nude and restrained spread-eagle, and then covered in prickledust. Prickledust is a powder that induces severe itching.</div>
					
					<div class="cityTitle">Shrinking</div>
					
					<div class="cityText">Shrinking refers to being reduced to between 1 and 4 inches tall and left to fend for oneself in this form until death. Many microcitizens are micro for this reason. Once resurrected (if they are), they will revert to their original form.</div>
					
					<div class="cityTitle">Slaughtering</div>
					
					<div class="cityText">When a citizen is sent to the Abbatoir as a form of punishment, it's known as slaughtering. Here, they'll be processed like any other piece of meat that enters the facility, and the resulting product will be sold to various shops and restaurants.</div>
					
					<div class="cityTitle">Splaying</div>
					
					<div class="cityText">Splaying is when a citizen's limbs are stretched taut between four posts, either by rope or spell. They're then left in the streets for usage by strangers.</div>
					
					<div class="cityTitle">The Tank</div>
					
					<div class="cityText">During the torture method known as the tank, the victim is placed in a clear, enclosed cylinder with an aureole (a magic portal) installed in the top. Through the portal, water, cum, waste, or another substance will slowly drain, filling the tank and eventually drowning the victim.
					</div>
					
					<div class="cityText" style="padding-top:2vh;text-align:center;"><b>A full list of punishments can be found <a href="https://nodd-arca.net/arcanet/index.php?title=Punishments" target="_blank">on the Arcanet.</a></b></div>
				</div>
				
				<div id="The Arcanet" class="tab" style="display:none">
					<div class="cityTitle">The Arcanet</div>
					
					<div class="cityText">​The arcanet contains all information about the world made public by the Council - one can find information about species, weather, upcoming events, and more. Most shops and services have a public hologram that can be accessed when concentrated upon; these often begin to partially manifest when one passes by the associated establishment. These holograms contain basic information and often the option to purchase items or download free samples to one’s ego bracer.</div>
					
					<div class="cityText">The arcanet is also home to a number of solo and competitive games playable on one’s ego bracer. Almost all of them require gloam to play, and promise substantial winnings. These are an easy and convenient way to gamble away one's livelihood.</div>
